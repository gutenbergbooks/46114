PREFACE
</p>

<p class="t3">
BY THE RT. HON. A. BONAR LAW, M.P.
</p>

<p>
The author of this book is an intimate personal
friend, and possibly for that reason I take too
favourable a view of his work; but I think he has
already rendered a great service, and not to Canada
alone.
</p>

<p>
As Canadian Record Officer, he published a
glowing account of the part played in the Battle
of Ypres by the Canadian contingent.  This account
was circulated widely, and it contributed largely to
make the deeds of the Canadian soldiers a
household word, not only throughout the Dominion, but
in the United Kingdom as well.
</p>

<p>
The present work seems to me a model of lucid,
picturesque, and sympathetic narrative, and it will
have, I feel sure, a lasting value.
</p>

<p>
We have a right to feel very proud of the part
which is being played in the terrible tragedy of this
war by the great Dominions of the British Crown.
We had no power to compel any one of them to
contribute a single penny, or to send a single man,
but they have given of their best, not to help us,
though I think they would have done that also, but
to defend the Empire which is theirs as much as
ours.
</p>

<p>
Led by a General who a few years ago was in
arms against us and who is the Prime Minister of
South Africa, the Union Government have wrested
from Germany a territory larger than the whole
German Empire; and a South African contingent
is now in England ready to play their part on the
battlefields of Flanders.
</p>

<p>
The Australians and New Zealanders have shown
in the Dardanelles that in courage, resourcefulness,
and tenacity better troops have never existed in the
world.  Whatever the final result of that operation
may be, the blood which has been shed there has not
been shed in vain.  Not to Australians and New
Zealanders alone, but to men of every race throughout
the British Empire, the Peninsula of Gallipoli
will for ever be sacred ground because of the brave
men who lie buried there.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "In glory will they sleep, and endless sanctity."<br />
</p>

<p>
What Canada has done, and is doing, shines out in
every page of this book.  Higher praise could not
be given than was contained in the despatch of the
Commander-in-Chief after the Battle of Ypres:
"In spite of the danger to which they were exposed,
the Canadians held their ground with a magnificent
display of tenacity and courage, and it is not too
much to say that the bearing and conduct of these
splendid troops averted a disaster which might have
been attended with most serious consequences."
</p>

<p>
Our enemies said, and probably they believed,
that the outbreak of war would be the signal for
the breaking-up of the British Empire.  They have
been mistaken.  After this war the relations between
the great Dominions and the Mother Country can
never be the same again.  The pressure of our
enemies is welding us together, and the British
Empire is becoming in reality, as well as in name,
a united nation.

INTRODUCTION
</p>

<p class="t3">
BY RT. HON. SIR ROBERT L. BORDEN, G.C.M.G.
</p>

<p>
More than a year ago the bugles of the Empire
sounded throughout the world the call to duty.  The
justice of the cause was recognised in every quarter
of the King's dominions, and nowhere more fully
than in Canada; it has since been confirmed by the
judgment of the civilised world.  Within a week
Canada had sprung to arms; within three weeks
35,000 men were marshalled on Valcartier Plain,
which had been transformed, as if by magic, into a
great military camp; within six weeks from the
outbreak of war a Canadian Division, fully organised
and equipped in every branch of the service, with
a surplus of guns and ammunition nearly sufficient
for another Division, and with a detail of
reinforcements amounting to 10,000 men, was ready to
proceed overseas.
</p>

<p>
Twice in September of last year I saw these forces
march past under review by the Duke of Connaught.
Later, I visited every unit of the contingent,
addressed their officers, and bade them all God-speed.
The Armada which left the shores of Gaspé on
October 3rd, 1914, carried the largest army that
ever crossed the Atlantic at one time.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of the following winter they went to
the front.  Few of them had any previous
experience of war.  They had lived in a peace-loving
country; they had been gathered from the varied
avocations of our national life; they had come from
the hills and valleys and surf-beaten shores of
the Maritime Provinces; from the banks of the
St. Lawrence and its hundred affluents in the two great
central Provinces; from the mining and lumber
camps of the north; from the broad prairie
Provinces and their northern hinterlands; from the
majesty of the mountains that look to the east upon
the prairies and to the west upon the Pacific; from
the shores of the great western ocean; from all the
far-flung communities of our Dominion they had
hurried, quickly responsive to the call.
</p>

<p>
Almost in the dawn of their experience at the
front there came to them an ordeal such as has
seldom tested the most tried of veterans.  An
unknown and terrible means of warfare, which
temporarily shattered the gallant forces that held the
line at their left, poured upon them torture and
death.  The bravest and most experienced troops
might well have been daunted and driven back by
the fierceness of the onslaught to which they were
exposed and by the horrible methods of the attack.
Assailed by overwhelming numbers on front and
flank, the held their own in a conflict which raged
for days; they barred the path against the German
onrush and saved the day for the Empire, for the
Allies and for the world.
</p>

<p>
The story of their tenacity, their valour, and their
heroism has been well told in the pages that follow.
But it can never be completely told.  Many of those
upon whom memories along splendid incidents of
that story were indelibly engraven lie beneath the
sod in Northern France and in Belgium.
</p>

<p>
On more than one stricken field the record thus
made by the 1st Canadian Division has held good.
From the lips of those who fought at Festubert
and at Givenchy, from dauntless survivors of the
Princess Patricia's Regiment, I have heard, in many
a hospital and convalescent home in the Motherland,
what their comrades had dared and done.
</p>

<p>
No Canadian can ever look forth unmoved upon
that valley where Ypres lies shattered in the
distance, and the sweep of the hills overlooks the
graves of more than 100,000 men who fell because
a remorseless militarist autocracy decreed this war.
</p>

<p>
In the years to come it will be the duty and the
pride of Canada to rear, both in this Dominion and
beyond the ocean, monuments which will worthily
commemorate the glorious deeds of her sons who
offered the supreme sacrifice for liberty and
civilisation.

AUTHOR'S NOTE
</p>

<p>
I am so conscious of the imperfections of the
chapters which follow that I was for long unwilling
to publish them in the form of a book.  They were
written under great difficulties and in many moods;
nor am I unaware that the excuse for collecting
them is very slender.  It was, however, represented
to me by persons of much authority, that the
subjects dealt with excited an interest so lively in
Canada that imperfections in the workmanship
would be readily overlooked in the Dominion.
</p>

<p>
I therefore publish my impressions of the
fortunes of the 1st Canadian Division and of Princess
Patricia's Regiment.  Some of the scenes described
fell in whole, or in part, under my own observation.
In dealing with others I have had access, in the
discharge of my duties, to a large number of
military diaries and official documents.
</p>

<p>
It may be stated that the greatest care is being
taken by the Canadian Government to collect and
preserve every authoritative document which may
hereafter throw light upon the military history of
the Canadian Expeditionary Force.  Nor is there
reason to doubt that the official historian of Canada
(whoever he may prove to be) will find abundant
material for a grave and adequate work.  Perhaps
such a one may find here and there in these hurriedly
written pages a contemporary echo, however faint
and elusive, of the clash and passion of war which
the author has attempted to describe.
</p>

<p>
I shall be content if one Canadian woman draws
solace from this poor record of her dead husband's
bravery; if even one reader recognises for the first
time the right of the Canadians to stand as equals
in the Temple of Valour with their Australian
brothers who fought and died at Anzac; if the task
of consolidating our Imperial resources, which may
be the one positive consequence of this orgy of
destruction, counts one adherent the more among
those who have honoured me by reading these
records.
</p>

<p>
And of Englishmen I ask nothing but that they
shall hereafter think of my countrymen as "Brothers
in whom a man trusts even if a great quarrel arises."

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
War came upon us without warning, like a
thunderbolt from a clear sky.  Our people were
essentially non-military, fearing no aggression from
a peace-loving neighbour, and ignorant of the
imminence of German aggression.  Yet, in seven weeks,
Canada created the first apparatus of war.  In seven
weeks we assembled an army which, a few months
later, was to save Calais on the battlefield of
Langemarck.  As a demonstration of practical loyalty the
exertions of Canada were only equalled by Australia
and New Zealand.  As an example of administration
rising to an emergency, the effort has never been
surpassed in military history.
</p>

<p>
When the British ultimatum to Germany demanding
the recognition of the neutrality of Belgium
expired, the Canadian Government decided to raise
an Expeditionary Force.  As this news flashed
across the Dominion, the fires of patriotism, which
had been smouldering, burst into flame in every
province.  Parliament was in vacation, but the
Prime Minister returned from the West and
summoned his Cabinet.  The Minister of Militia was
already at work in his office, for the proposal of the
Canadian Government to raise 20,000 men had
been accepted by the British Government.
</p>

<p>
Within two months of the outbreak of war between
Great Britain and Germany, the Dominion of
Canada concentrated, armed, and sent to Europe
an Expeditionary Force of 33,000 men.  A
voluntary army, the first complete Canadian Division
ever assembled, with more than half a Reserve
Division, this force was by far the greatest body
of soldiers that had ever crossed the Atlantic at
one time.  It comprised cavalry, artillery, infantry,
engineers, signallers, supply and ammunition
columns, field ambulances and hospital staffs,
provided with all the apparatus required for the
handling and treatment of the wounded; it carried
its own complement of rifles, machine guns, field
guns, and heavy artillery, and a store of ammunition.
</p>

<p>
It was not the first time that Canadians
had taken up arms in defence of Imperial
interests.  In the Crimean War, Canadians fought in
the ranks of the British Army.  The Indian Mutiny
saw the old Prince of Wales' Royal Canadian
Regiment at Gibraltar and at Malta.  More than
7,000 Canadians fought for England in the South
African War.  But now the Empire was to be tested
to its foundations.  The Minister of Militia,
Major-General the Hon. Sir Sam Hughes, K.C.B., acted
with the promptness and energy for which he was
already famous in the Dominion.  In less than a
month the Government, which had asked for 20,000
men, found almost 40,000 at its disposal, and the
Minister of Militia deemed it necessary to issue
orders that no more recruits be enrolled for the first
contingent.
</p>

<p>
Thus did Canada answer the call.  From the workshops
and the offices of her cities, from the lumber
camps of her forests, from the vast wheatfields of
the West, from the farms and orchards of the East,
from the slopes of the Rockies, from the shores of
Hudson Bay, from the mining valleys of British
Columbia, from the banks of the Yukon, from the
reaches of the St. Lawrence, the manhood of Canada
hurried to arms.
</p>

<p>
No mere jackboot militarism inspired them.  They
sought neither the glory of conquest nor the rape
of freedom, nor the loot of sacked cities.  No selfish
ideal led them to leave their homes and exchange
the ease and comforts of civil life for the sufferings
of war and the risk of death.  They came forward,
free men and unconstrained, with a simple resolve
to lay down their lives, if need be, in defence of
the Empire&mdash;their Empire too&mdash;the very existence
of which, as they swiftly saw, was menaced by the
most formidable military combination which had
ever sprung to arms.  The first contingent was born
partly of the glory of adventure but more of the
spirit of self-sacrifice; and this spirit, in its turn,
was born of the deepest emotions of the Canadian
people&mdash;its love of Country, of Liberty, and of
Right.
</p>

<p>
The Government, in deciding to raise a contingent
for service in Europe, were carrying out the national
will, and when Parliament entered upon its special
session, some days after the declaration of War,
unanimity prevailed.  The Prime Minister spoke
for all parties when he declared that Canada
stood "shoulder to shoulder with Britain and
the other British Dominions in this quarrel."  Sir
Wilfrid Laurier spoke of the "double honour"
of Canadians of French descent in the opportunity
of "taking their place to-day in the ranks of the
Canadian Army to fight for the cause of the allied
nations."  The Government announced its further
intention of raising a sum of fifty millions of dollars
for war purposes.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the policy of the Government had
been ratified, General Hughes devised and ordered
the establishment of the largest camp that had ever
been seen on Canadian soil.  The site at Valcartier
was well chosen.  It lay some sixteen miles to the
west of Quebec, within a day's march of the gathering
transports.  The soil was, in the main, light and
sandy, and a river of pure water was available.
Yet the work of adapting this virgin soil to
military purposes was enormous, and the transformation,
effected within a fortnight by an army of
engineers and workers, a remarkable triumph
of applied science.  Roads were made, drains laid
down, a water supply with miles of pipes installed,
electric lighting furnished from Quebec, and
incinerators built for the destruction of dry refuse.  A
sanitary system, second to none that any camp has
seen, was instituted.  Every company had its own
bathing place and shower baths; every cookhouse
its own supply of water.  Troughs of drinking-water,
for horses, filled automatically, so that there was
neither shortage nor waste.  The standing crops
were garnered, trees cut down and their roots torn
up.  A line of rifle targets 3-½ miles long&mdash;the largest
rifle range in the world&mdash;was constructed.  Three
miles of sidings were run out from the wayside
station, and a camp telephone exchange was quickly
put in working order.
</p>

<p>
Camp and army leaped to life in the same hours.
Within four days of the opening of the camp, nearly
6,000 men had arrived in it.  A week later the
number was 25,000.  In those August days all
roads led to Valcartier, and the railways rose to
the occasion, gathering the first Division to the
rendezvous, from every corner of the country, in great
trains, each of which carried and fed 600 men.
</p>

<p>
The assembling force comprised elements from
every phase of Canadian life.  There were those
whose names were known throughout the land.
There were men who had fought at Paardeburg&mdash;some
of them "very barely" within the age limit of
45.  One, who had retired from a colonelcy of a
regiment, offered to serve as a private, so anxious
was he to go.  He was more than satisfied when he
received a majority.  Another, who had spent his
fifteenth birthday as a bugler in South Africa, has
since celebrated his third war birthday in the Flemish
trenches.
</p>

<p>
The original intention of the authorities was
to send to England a Division, consisting of the
regular complement of three infantry brigades; but,
on September 1st, General Hughes announced at
the camp that a fourth brigade would be formed,
to be used as drafts to supply the war wastage in
the other three.  Towards the end of the month
the Government decided to send all four brigades
over together.  "The total reinforcements for the
first year of a great war," said Sir Robert Borden
in announcing his decision, "are estimated at from
60 to 70 per cent.  If the reserve depots necessary
for supplying such reinforcements were established
in Canada, eight or ten weeks might elapse before
they could reach the front....  For these reasons,
as well as others, we deem it advisable that the
reserves shall be kept on hand in Great Britain, as
the Force at the front must continually be kept at
full strength, and that without the slightest
unnecessary delay."
</p>

<p>
While the new army underwent its preliminary
training at Valcartier, there were other preparations
of every kind to be made.  The cloth mills of
Montreal began to hum with the manufacture of khaki,
which the needles of a great army of tailors
converted into uniforms, greatcoats and cloaks.  The
Ordnance Department equipped the host with the
Ross rifle&mdash;a Canadian-made arm.  Regiments were
shuffled and reshuffled into battalions; battalions
into brigades.  The whole force was inoculated
against typhoid.  There were stores to manufacture
and to accumulate; a fleet of transports to assemble;
a thousand small cogs in the machine to be nicely
adjusted.
</p>

<p>
Early in September, the whole First Division was
reviewed by the Governor-General in a torrential
downpour of rain; and again, towards the end of
the month, a few days before embarkation, the Duke
of Connaught (accompanied by the Duchess and the
Princess Patricia) took the salute at Valcartier from
the first army of Canada.  At this final review the
contingent was fittingly led past the saluting base
by the man whose name, more than any one other,
will be linked in history with the first Canadian
Division.  General Hughes had cause to be proud of
the 33,000 men who marched past that day, fully
armed and fully equipped, well within two months
of the declaration of war in Europe.
</p>

<p>
The feat of raising such a force is all the more
remarkable when one considers that, with the
exception of the Princess Patricia's Light Infantry,
the overwhelming majority of the men who
volunteered for the great War were civilians, without
previous experience or training.  The "Princess
Pats," as that already famous regiment is now
commonly called, was the only one that consisted
almost entirely of old soldiers.
</p>

<p>
The Governor-General's review over, news from
the camp came fitfully.  The censor was at work,
and the public guessed rightly that the division was
on the move.  Through the darkness and the rain
and the mud of the night of September 23rd-24th,
the guns crawled down the sixteen miles of valley
that brought them to Quebec at daybreak, the men
drenched, but happy in the knowledge that they were
at last off to the war.  The weather was so bad that
the infantry, instead of marching, were brought
down in a long succession of heavy trains.  The
embarkation of horses, men, guns and wagons was
completed in less than three days.  And so the First
Canadian Division, with its Reserves, sailed away
down the St. Lawrence, in a fleet of Atlantic liners
such as the mighty gateway of Canada had never
before borne on her bosom.
</p>

<p>
The fleet assembled in Gaspé Basin, on the coast
of Quebec, where the warships which were to convoy
it across the Atlantic awaited it.  On October
3rd the transports steamed out of Gaspé Bay
in three lines ahead, led by His Majesty's ships
<i>Charybdis</i>, <i>Diana</i>, and <i>Eclipse</i>, with the <i>Glory</i> and
<i>Suffolk</i> on the flanks, and the <i>Talbot</i> in the rear.
Later, the <i>Suffolk's</i> place was taken by the
battle-cruiser, <i>Queen Mary</i>.  The sealing-ship
<i>Florizel</i>, with the Newfoundland Regiment aboard,
joined the fleet after its departure from Gaspé Bay.
</p>

<p>
The voyage was uneventful if rather long, the
fleet entering Plymouth Sound on the evening of
October 14th.  So strict had been the censorship
that the arrival of the Canadian Armada was quite
unexpected by the people of Plymouth and Devonport;
but no sooner had the word gone forth that the
Canadian transports had arrived, than the townsfolk
flocked to the waterside, to cheer and sing, and cheer
again.
</p>

<p>
No one was allowed on board the transports, but,
when on the succeeding days the troops were landed
and marched through the streets, they received a
welcome which they will never forget.  Hundreds
of the men had relatives and friends who were
anxious to catch a glimpse of them at the docks,
but access was refused.  The only exception
made throughout the various disembarkations
was in the case of the late Field-Marshal Lord
Roberts.
</p>

<p>
Lieut.-General Alderson[<a id="chap01fn1text"></a><a href="#chap01fn1">1</a>] had been appointed to
the command of the contingent, and visited the
commanding officers before the work of disembarkation
began.
</p>

<p>
The Canadian Division, the Princess Patricia's
Canadian Light Infantry, and the Newfoundland
Regiment occupied camps on Salisbury Plain at
Bustard, West Down South, West Down North,
Pond Farm, Lark Hill, and Sling Plantation.  Here
the Canadians remained until their departure for
France.  Here, in the mud and cold and rain of
those four dismal months, they worked and lived
and displayed that spirit of endurance, courage,
and willingness which has since proclaimed them
</p>

<p>
to the world as troops of the finest quality.  On
the sodden grazing lands, in the fog and mud of
the battalion lines, in the dripping tents and
crowded, reeking huts, the men of Canada gave
promise of the great spirit they possessed, and their
officers saw it and were proud.
</p>

<p>
Lord Roberts visited the Division soon after its
arrival in England.  It was the last public
appearance of this great soldier in England, and the
following are the principal points in his speech to
the Canadian troops:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="quote">

"Three months ago we found ourselves involved
in this war, a war not of our own seeking;
but one which those who have studied
Germany's literature and Germany's aspirations,
knew was a war which we should inevitably
have to deal with sooner or later.  The prompt
resolve of Canada to give us such valuable
assistance, has touched us deeply.  That
resolve has been quickened into action in a
marvellously short space of time, under the
excellent organising and driving power of your
Minister of Militia&mdash;my friend, Major-General
Hughes.

<p>
The King paid his first visit to our troops early
in November.  His Majesty was accompanied by
Field-Marshals Lords Roberts and Kitchener, Sir
George Perley, Member of the Canadian Cabinet in
charge of the office of the High Commissioner in
London,[<a id="chap01fn3text"></a><a href="#chap01fn3">3</a>] and Sir Richard McBride, Prime Minister
of British Columbia.
</p>

<p>
The Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry
left Salisbury Plain early in December and joined
the 27th British Division.  The Regiment was
brigaded with the 3rd King's Royal Rifles, 4th
King's Royal Rifles, 4th Rifle Brigade, and 2nd
King's Shropshire Light Infantry.
</p>

<p>
The King again visited the Canadian troops on
February 4th, 1915; and on the following day
a Division composed of three infantry brigades, three
artillery brigades, ammunition column, divisional
engineers, divisional mounted troops, and divisional
train, marched off Salisbury Plain and entrained for
their port of embarkation under the command of
Lieut.-General Alderson.
</p>

<p>
Lieut.-Colonel (now Major-General) M. S. Mercer
commanded the 1st Infantry Brigade, which was
composed of the 1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment)
under Lieut.-Colonel F. W. Hill, the 2nd Battalion
under Lieut.-Colonel (now Brigadier-General) David
Watson, the 3rd Battalion (Toronto Regiment) under
Lieut.-Colonel (now Brigadier-General) R. Rennie,
and the 4th Battalion under Lieut.-Colonel
A. P. Birchall, who was killed in action.
</p>

<p>
The 2nd Infantry Brigade was commanded, by
Lieut.-Colonel A. W. Currie (now Major-General),
and his four battalions, the 5th, 7th, 8th, and 10th,
were commanded respectively by Lieut.-Colonels
G. S. Tuxford, W. F. H. Hart-McHarg, L. J. Lipsett
(now Brigadier-General), and R. L. Boyle.
Colonels Hart-McHarg and Boyle fell
at Ypres.
</p>

<p>
Colonel R. E. W. Turner, V.C., D.S.O., who has
since been promoted to the rank of Major-General,
commanded the 3rd Infantry Brigade, with
Lieut.-Colonels F. O. W. Loomis, F. S. Meighen (now
Brigadier-General), J. A. Currie, and R. G. E. Leckie
(since promoted to Brigadier-General)
commanding respectively the 13th Battalion (Royal
Highlanders of Canada), the 14th Battalion (Royal
Montreal Regiment), the 15th Battalion (48th
Highlanders of Canada), and the 16th Battalion
(Canadian Scottish).
</p>

<p>
Lieut.-Colonel (now Brigadier-General)
H. E. Burstall commanded the Canadian Artillery, with
Lieut.-Colonels E. W. B. Morrison (now Brigadier-General),
J. J. Creelman and J. H. Mitchell commanding
artillery brigades.  The Officer Commanding
Divisional Engineers was Lieut.-Colonel
C. J. Armstrong (now Brigadier-General); Lieut.-Colonel
F. C. Jameson was in command of the Divisional
Mounted Troops and Major F. A. Lister of the
Divisional Signal Company.
</p>

<p>
The Division sailed from Avonmouth, and the last
transport reached St. Nazaire, on the Bay of Biscay,
in the second week of February.
</p>

<p>
The 6th, 9th, 11th, 12th, and 17th Battalions
were left in England as the Base Brigade of the
Division.  These battalions were formed later into
the Canadian Training Depot; later still, together
with reinforcements from Canada, into the Canadian
Training Division, under the command of
Brigadier-General J. C. MacDougall.
</p>

<p>
Such, in its principal commands, was the Army
which left Canada for the Great Adventure.  It
carried with it, and it left behind, high hopes.  It was
certain that no men of finer physique or higher
courage could be found anywhere in any theatre of
this immense struggle.  But there were some&mdash;and
these neither faint-hearted nor unpatriotic&mdash;who
recalled with anxiety the scientific organisation and
the tireless patience with which Germany had set
herself to create the most superb military instrument
which the world has ever seen.  And they may have
been forgiven if they asked themselves:
</p>

<p>
"Can civilians, however brave and intelligent, be
made in a few months the equals of those inspired
veterans who are swarming in triumph over the
battlefields of Europe?"
</p>

<p>
"Can Generals, and Staffs, and officers be
improvised, able to compete with the scientific
output of the most scientific General Staff which
has ever conceived and carried out military
operations?"
</p>

<p>
These were formidable questions, and even a
bold man might have shrunk from a confident
answer.
</p>

<p>
The story of Canada in Flanders, however
inadequately told, will make it unnecessary ever to
ask them again.

[<a href="#chap01fn1text">1</a>] Lieut.-General Edwin Alfred Hervey Alderson, C.B.,
has a distinguished record of service.  He was born in 1859, at
Ipswich, and began his military career with the Militia, from
which he passed to the Regular Army in December, 1878.  He
joined the Royal West Kent Regiment as Second Lieutenant, and
was promoted to Lieutenant in July, 1881; and in this year he
first saw active service with the Natal Field Force in the
Transvaal campaign.  He was ordered to Egypt in the following year,
serving there with the mounted infantry.  He was in two actions,
at Kassassin and at the battle of Tel-el-Kebir on September
13th.  He received the medal with clasp and the Khedive's
bronze star.  Lieut. Alderson took part in the Nile Expedition
of 1884-1885.  He was promoted Captain in June, 1886, and
Major in May, 1896, and received the brevet of Lieut.-Colonel in
1897.  In 1896 and 1897 he served in South Africa under Sir
Frederick Carrington.  In October, 1899, he was given the
command of the mounted infantry of the 1st Cavalry Brigade.
His services throughout the South African campaign were constant
and distinguished.  In 1903 he was promoted Colonel, and
appointed to the command of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, 1st Army
Corps.  He became a Major-General in 1906, and in 1908
commanded the 6th Division, Southern Army, India.  His rank
of Lieut.-General dates from October 14th, 1914.  General Alderson
has received the honour of K.C.B. since this book was in the press.

<p><br /></p>

<p>
After a slow journey by rail of 350 miles from
the landing point in France, the Canadians reached
a wayside station which lies about twelve miles due
west of Ploegsteert&mdash;the war-historic "Plug Street"
wood, which British regiments had already made
famous.  At this point the Canadians were well
within that triangle of country lying between
St. Omer to the west, the ruins of Ypres to the east,
and Bethune to the south, which at that time
contained the entire British Army in France.
</p>

<p>
It was one of the most remarkably interesting
pieces of triangular territory imaginable, full of
movement, romance, and the intricate detail of
organisation.  Within it lay the already wonderful
beginnings of the great British force as it is to-day,
and I will do my best to make clear how, within that
triangle, the first British Army lived, moved, fought,
and generally had its being.
</p>

<p>
You must picture the British Army in the field,
spread out like a fan.  The long, wavy edge of the
fan is the line of men in the firing trenches, at the
very forefront of affairs, often within a stone's-throw
of the opposing German line.  Some hundreds of
yards behind this firing line lie the support trenches,
also filled with men.  The men in the firing and
supporting trenches exchange places every forty-eight
hours.  After a four days' spell they all retire
for four days' rest, fresh troops taking their places
as they move out.  At the end of their four days'
rest they return again to the trenches.  All relieving
movements are carried out in the dark to avoid the
enemy's rifle fire.
</p>

<p>
Further back, along the ribs of the fan, one finds
the headquarters of the many brigades; behind
these, headquarters of divisions; then headquarters
of army corps, then of armies&mdash;the groups becoming
fewer and fewer in number as you recede&mdash;until,
at the end of the fan handle, one reaches the General
Headquarters, where the Commander-in-Chief
stands, with his hand on the dynamo which sends
its impulses through every part of the great machine
spread out in front.
</p>

<p>
From General Headquarters the movements of the
entire British Army, or rather of the several British
armies, are directed and controlled.  It is a War
Office in the field, with numerous branches closely
co-ordinated and working together like a single
machine.  Here is the operations office, where plans
of attack are worked out under the direction of the
Commander-in-Chief and his chief of staff.
</p>

<p>
Near by is the building occupied by the "signals"
branch, which with its nerve system of telegraphs,
telephones, and motor-cycle despatch riders, is the
medium of communication with every part of the
field, and also with the base of supplies and the War
Office in London.  "Signals" carries its wires to
within rifle shot of the trenches, and every division
of the Army has its own field telephones from
battalions headquarters to the firing line.
</p>

<p>
Close at hand is the office of the intelligence
branch, which collects and communicates information
about the enemy from every source it can tap.
It receives and compares reports of statements made
by prisoners, and interrogates some prisoners itself.
It goes through documents, letters, diaries, official
papers&mdash;captured in the field&mdash;and extracts points
from these.  It collects news from its own
agents&mdash;it is only your enemy who calls them
spies&mdash;about events that are happening, or are likely
to happen, behind the screen of the enemy's lines.
</p>

<p>
At General Headquarters you find the department
of the Adjutant-General, who is responsible for the
whole of the arrangements&mdash;keeping the army in the
field supplied with men and munitions of war, for
the transfer of all prisoners to the base, for the trial
of offences against discipline, and for the spiritual
welfare of the troops.
</p>

<p>
From a neighbouring office the Quartermaster-General
controls the movements of food and fodder
for men and horses, and all other stores, other than
actual munitions of war.
</p>

<p>
Still another branch houses the Director-General
of Medical Service, who supervises the treatment of
the wounded from the field aid post to the field
clearing station, from there to the hospital train,
and thence to the base hospital in France or Great
Britain.
</p>

<p>
One of the most fascinating spots at General
Headquarters is the map department.  Thousands of
maps of various kinds and sizes have been produced
here since the war began.  They vary from large
maps, to be hung on walls or spread on great tables,
down to small slips&mdash;with a few lines of German
trenches accurately outlined&mdash;and most handy for
the use of battery and battalion commanders.
Remarkable photographs are also printed
here&mdash;panoramic views and photographs of German
positions, taken at very close quarters, often under fire.
There are officers who specialise in this perilous and
wonderful business.
</p>

<p>
As one goes forward from General Headquarters
towards the edge of the fan, one comes in contact
with more and more men, and realises quickly that,
in spite of the hardships of trench warfare, our
troops are superbly fit and ready for any task which
the fortunes of war may impose on them.  Their
physical condition remains so robust as to be
astonishing.
</p>

<p>
For instance, the evening that I reached the
billeting area, I saw several battalions of the
Expeditionary Force marching from their billets
towards the trenches&mdash;they had been at the front for
months, yet they stepped as freshly as though they
were just from home or route-marching in English
lanes.  Their faces shone with health; their eyes were
as bright as those of a troop of schoolboys.  They
were, in fact, tramping down a long, straight,
poplar-lined Flemish highway, with a misty vista of flat
ploughed land on either side.  They whistled as
they marched.
</p>

<p>
The complete efficiency of the men is largely due
to the excellence of their food.  The Army is, in
fact, healthier than any other army that has ever
faced war.  Typhoid is almost unknown.  The
amazing record of health owes much to the sanitary
precautions which are taken.  One of the most
remarkable of these is the system of hot baths and
the sterilising of clothing.
</p>

<p>
Bathing establishments have been put up in
various parts of the field, and the largest of them is
in a building which, before the war, was a jute
factory.  Every hour of the day, successive
companies of men have hot baths here.  They strip
to the skin, and while they wallow in huge vats of
hot water, their clothing is treated with 200 degrees
of heat, which destroys all vermin.
</p>

<p>
At first the small towns, the villages, and the many
farmhouses and cottages within easy reach of the
firing line provided all the rest billets.  A great
many men are billeted in this way still.  I found,
for instance, a company of Territorials snugly resting
in a huge farm, the officers having quarters in the
farmhouse on the other side of the yard; but
recently a large number of wooden huts have been
put up in various places across the countryside, and
here the men come back from the trenches to
rest.  They are tired when they come "home,"
but a sound sleep, a wash, a hearty breakfast,
and a stroll in the fresh air&mdash;out of range of the
insistent bullets&mdash;have a magical effect.  In the
afternoon you find them playing football as blithely as
boys, and those who are not playing stand round and
chaff and applaud.  I saw as many games of football
one day, in the course of a motor run behind the
lines, as one would see on a Saturday afternoon in
England.
</p>

<p>
Every day brings its letters and newspapers&mdash;every
rail-head has its little travelling letter office
shunted into a siding.  Here the letters of a division
are sorted.  They average more than one letter a
day for every man in the field.  That is another
reason why the Army is in good spirits.  No army
in the world before ever got so much news from
home, so regularly and so quickly.  Besides this,
drafts of men are constantly being sent home&mdash;across
the Channel&mdash;for five or seven days' leave.
</p>

<p>
The firing line is not much further from the base
than London is from the sea.  One passes on
through the region of rest billets and headquarters
of sections of troops, and arrives behind the firing
line.  When the Canadians first landed, the British
forces held a front between twenty and thirty miles
long, running from Ypres, on the north, where the
Seventh Division made its heroic stand against the
Prussian Guards, to Givenchy, on the south, near
the scene of the battle of Neuve Chapelle.
</p>

<p>
This stretch had been held ever since the British
troops made their swift dart from the Aisne to
Flanders, hoping (how strange it seems now) to
outflank the Germans, and in fact, by immense
exertions, defeating a far more formidable outflanking
movement by the enemy.  Here they have maintained
their ground.  They lived and fought in
seas of mud all through the winter.  The water
was pumped out of the trenches with hand-pumps,
only to ooze back again through the sodden
soil.  Plank platforms were put down, and straw
was piled in.  Yet the mud smothered everything.
The men stood in mud, sat in mud, and lay in mud.
Often it was as much as they could do to prevent the
mud from clogging their rifles.  They crawled
through mud to the trenches when it was their time
to relieve those in the firing line.  They had to hide
in the mud of the trenches to escape the German
bullets.  It was a choice of mud or death.  With
the arrival of spring, conditions were improved.
There was less rain, and the winds had begun to
dry the ground.  On fine days there was even dust
on the paved roads, although the quagmire of mud,
each side of the centre strip of granite, still remained.
The trench mud was becoming firmer.
</p>

<p>
The line of trenches runs nearly everywhere
through low-lying ground, intersected with watery
ditches and small streams; the land is so level,
and the atmosphere so heavy, that, as a rule,
the eye ranges little further than a rifle bullet will
carry.  The nearer the firing line the more difficult
you find it to set eyes on men.  Thousands of men
are almost within hailing distance, but none are to
be seen.  Friend and foe alike are hidden in the
trenches.
</p>

<p>
Some of the most famous trenches are in a wood
that is known to all the army as "Plug Street,"
although, as I have already made clear, it is spelled
a little differently on the maps.  To reach the
trenches you have, of course, to come within
rifle-shot of the enemy, for in most places the German
and British trenches are not more than 250 yards
from each other, and here and there they are only
40 or 50 yards apart.  One creeps and crawls at
dusk along paths which months of experience has
told the soldiers are the best means of approach;
and one eventually scrambles into a communication
trench which, in a number of zig-zags, leads you to
the firing trench, where the men are waiting, rifle in
hand, in case of attack, or now and again taking a
snap-shot through a loophole in the trench parapet.
</p>

<p>
The trenches in "Plug Street" are like all the
other trenches&mdash;very exciting to think about before
you reach them, but, unless you happen to arrive
when shells are bursting overhead, comparatively dull
and matter-of-fact when you are actually there.  It
is only the chance of death that gives them their
peculiar interest over other holes excavated by men
in clammy earth.  The bee-like buzz of an
occasional bullet overhead reminds you that death is
searching for its prey.  "Plug Street" has a fame
which will endure.  All through the first winter, the
men squashed about in its awful mud, making quite
a number of slimy, ankle-deep, or knee-deep lanes
from point to point among the trees.  In course of
time each of the muddy woodland alleys received
its nickname from the men in the ranks.
</p>

<p>
Such was the appearance and atmosphere of things
at the front when the Canadians first arrived.  After
a few days of special instruction they were billeted
in the area of the First Army under Sir Douglas
Haig.  The Divisional Headquarters were located
near Estaires, with the Brigade Headquarters in
advanced positions, and the "Front" is clearly
indicated by the sketch on page 37.
</p>

<p>
I have described, as fully as is permissible, the
general disposition and the general organisation
of the British Army in the field as it was when the
Canadians first set foot in France.  It now becomes
necessary to deal in detail with the "Front"&mdash;that
almost endless succession of warren-like lines where
scores of thousands of men stand to arms by night and
day, and where the Canadian troops have already
fought with a gallantry and a dash, and yet a tenacity,
which have seldom, if ever, been equalled in military
history.
</p>

<p>
None can examine what, for want of a better name,
is called the "Front" of this amazing war, without
realising the truth of what has been so often
said&mdash;that it is a war almost without a "Front."
</p>

<p>
As one approaches from a distance the actual
point of contact between the opposing forces, one is
struck ever more and more by the immense numbers
which are converging, as it seems, for some great
military purpose.  But the nearer the front
approaches the more completely does all that is
spectacular disappear, until, finally, the flower of the
youth of Europe vanishes and is swallowed up by
immense but barely visible lines of field
fortifications.
</p>

<p>
And now the Canadian Division, too, has reached
the front.  The long, the tedious winter discomfort
of Salisbury Plain, never resented but always
disliked, already seems far away.  No one in the
Canadian Division grudges the honour which was paid
to Princess Patricia's Light Infantry, to carry first
the badge of Canada on the battlefields of Flanders.
It was freely recognised that this Regiment had
arrived with greater technical knowledge and had
reached a degree of efficiency which the other
battalions could hardly equal without longer
preparation.  The fortunes of the Princess Patricias
will be told in another chapter, but it can be said
that the Battalion has proved itself worthy of fighting
side by side, and on equal terms, with the army of
veterans and heroes which held the trenches during
the first horrible winter in Flanders.
</p>

<p>
It is a story which will demand the utmost care
in the telling, and, in any case, much that would be
of the greatest interest must of necessity be omitted,
because, in face of the superb organisation of the
German Intelligence Department, it might be
mischievous to publish details of units, and of their
doings, as long as the general military formations in
which these units play a part remain unchanged.  It
is out of respect for this consideration that the day
for giving full honours to units by exact identification
has so often to be postponed, so that the records
of our men's heroism only appear when, in the
maelstrom of fresh splendid deeds, they are already
half forgotten.
</p>

<p>
This volume, and those which it is hoped will
follow it, must always be read in the light of these
most necessary restrictions.  Nevertheless it is
possible, while observing every rule which has been
laid down for our guidance, to give a general picture
of the Canadian Division, its surroundings and its
doings, which, whether it interests other people or
not, will not be read without emotion by those who
sent their sons and brothers to the greatest battlefields
of history in support of principles which, in
their general application, are as important to the
liberties of Canada as they are to the liberties of
Europe.
</p>

<p>
Before the Canadians took up their allotted
positions in the trenches they marched past the
Commander-in-Chief and his Staff.  Those who watched
the troops defile in the grey, square market-place of
a typical Flanders town, were experienced judges of
the physique and quality of soldiers.  No one
desires in such a connection to use exaggerated
language, and it is therefore unnecessary to say
more than that the unanimous view of those who
watched so intently and so critically, was that,
judging the men by their physique and their soldierly
swing, no more promising troops had come to swell
our ranks since the day the Expeditionary Force
landed in France.
</p>

<p>
When the Canadian troops first took their turn as
a Division in the trenches, nothing sensational
happened to them.  It was not their fortune, at the
outset, to be swung forward in a desperate attack, or
to cling in defensive tenacity to trenches which the
Germans had resolved to master.  There were, of
course, casualties.  One does not enter or leave
trenches without casualties, for the sniper never fails
to claim his daily toll, but the early trench
experiences of the Canadians were not eventful, as one
judges incidents in this war.  This period of
immunity, however, was all to the good.  Whatever
else he is, the Canadian is adaptable, and the
experience of these weeks brought him more wisdom
than others might have drawn from it.
</p>

<p>
Work in the trenches no longer involves, in respect
of duration, the heartbreaking strain which was
imposed upon all in the dark and anxious days of
the autumn of 1914, when a thin line of khaki held,
often wholly unsupported by reserves, so immense
a line against superior forces.  Trench work now,
in relation to the period of exposure, is well within
the powers of stout and resolute troops.  For a
certain period, relays of the force take their turn in
holding their lines.  When that period is passed
they are relieved by their comrades.
</p>

<p>
Exciting, if occasionally monotonous, though life
in the trenches may be, it is strange to a Canadian,
and deeply interesting, to study the tiny town in
which the troops in repose are billeted, and the
hustling life on which they have already stamped so
much of their individuality.  Picture to yourself a
narrow street, the centre paved, the sides of tenacious
mud.  Line it on each side with houses, rather
squalid, and with a few unimportant stores.  Add a
château (not a grand one) for the Headquarters, a
modest office for the Staff, and you have a fair
conception of the billeting place which shelters that
part of the division which reposes.  But this town
is like many other towns in this unattractive country.
Its interest to us lies in the tenants of the moment.
Walk down the street, and you will, if you are
a Canadian, feel at once something familiar and
homelike in the atmosphere.  One hears voices
everywhere, and one does not need the sight of the
brass shoulder badges, "CANADA," to know the
race to which these voices belong.  It may be the
speech of Nova Scotia, it may be the voice of British
Columbia, or it may be the accents in which the
French-Canadian seeks to adapt to the French of
Flanders the tongue which his ancestors, centuries
ago, carried to a new world; but, whichever it be&mdash;it
is all Canadian.
</p>

<p>
And soon, a company swings by, going perhaps to
bath parade&mdash;to that expeditious process which, in
half an hour, has cleansed the bathers and fumigated
every rag which they possess.  And as they pass they
sing carelessly, but with a challenging catch, a song
which, if by chance you come from Toronto, will
perhaps stir some association.  For these, or many
of them, are boys from the College; and the song is
the University song whose refrain is, "Toronto."
</p>

<p>
And if you go still a little further in the direction
of the front, you will soon&mdash;very soon&mdash;after leaving
the place of billeting, come to the country over which
the great guns, by day and night, contend for mastery.
And as one advances, there seem to be Canadians
everywhere.  Here are batteries, skilfully masked.
Here are supplies on their way to the trenches.  And
all the time can be seen reliefs and reserves until it
is strange to meet anyone not in khaki and without
the badge of "CANADA."  The passion for football,
which the Canadian has begun to share with his
English comrade, abates none of its keenness as he
marches nearer to the front.  A spirited match was
in progress near our lines not long ago when a
distracting succession of "Weary Willies" began to
distribute themselves not very far from the football
ground.  The only people who took no notice were
the players, and nothing short of a peremptory order
from the Provost Marshal brought to an end a game
which was somewhat unnecessarily dangerous.
And our men have, of course, made the acquaintance
of "Jack Johnson," and without liking him&mdash;for
he is not likeable&mdash;they endure him with
as much constancy as brave men need.  Nor,
indeed, have our own artillery failed to do more
than hold their own.  The gunners inherited
from the division which preceded them in the
trenches a disagreeable inheritance in the shape of
an observation post which had long harassed and
menaced our lines by the information which it placed
at the disposal of the enemy.  We were so fortunate
as to put it out of action in the third round which we
fired&mdash;a success very welcome as an encouragement,
and giving a substantial relief from an unwholesome
scrutiny.
</p>

<p>
Our infantry were not specially engaged in the
fighting at Neuve Chapelle, but our artillery played
its part in that triumph of artillery science which
preceded the British attack, and our men were ready
during the whole fight for the order which, had the
tactical situation so developed, would have sent them,
too, to make their first assault upon the German
trenches.  And there were not a few who were
longing for that order.  They thought that the Germans
had presumed upon a slight acquaintance.  For,
the very first night on which our men were put into
the trenches, the Germans began to call out, "Come
out, you Canadians!  Come out and fight!"  Now,
the trenches at normal times have their own code of
manners and of amenity, and this challenge was, and
is, regarded as impertinent.
</p>

<p>
The Canadian brings his own phrases into his
daily life.  When the German flares in the trenches
nervously lighted up the space between the two
lines, "There are the Northern Lights" was the
comment of Canada; and "Northern Lights" they
have remained to this day.
</p>

<p>
It would be evidently impertinent to say more of
the General Officer Commanding the force, General
Alderson, than that he enjoys the most absolute
confidence of the fine force he commands.  He
trusts them, and they trust him; and it will be strange
if their co-operation does not prove fruitful.  And
an observer is at once struck by the extraordinarily
accurate knowledge which the General has gained
of the whole body of regimental officers under his
command.  He seems to know them as well by
name and sight, as if he had commanded the force
for six years instead of six months.  And this is a
circumstance which, in critical moments, counts for
much.
</p>

<p>
General Alderson's methods&mdash;his practical and
soldierly style&mdash;could not be better illustrated than
by some extracts from the speech which he addressed
to the troops before they went into the trenches for
the first time:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"All ranks of the Canadian Division: We are
about to occupy and maintain a line of trenches.
I have some things to say to you at this moment
which it is well that you should consider.  You are
taking over good and, on the whole, dry trenches.
I have visited some myself.  They are intact, and
the parapets are good.  Let me warn you first that
we have already had several casualties while you
have been attached to other divisions.  Some of
those casualties were unavoidable, and that is war.
But I suspect that some&mdash;at least a few&mdash;could have
been avoided.  I have heard of cases in which men
have exposed themselves with no military object,
and perhaps only to gratify curiosity.  We cannot
lose good men like this.  We shall want them all
if we advance, and we shall want them all if the
Germans advance.  Do not expose your heads, and
do not look round corners, unless for a purpose
which is necessary at the moment you do it.  It will
not often be necessary.  You are provided with
means of observing the enemy without exposing
your heads.  To lose your lives without military
necessity is to deprive the State of good soldiers.
Young and brave men enjoy taking risks.  But a
soldier who takes unnecessary risks through levity,
is not playing the game.  And the man who does so
is stupid, for whatever be the average practice of
the German Army, the individual shots they
employ as snipers shoot straight, and, screened from
observation behind the lines, they are always
watching.  And if you put your head over the parapet
without orders they will hit that head.
</p>

<p>
"There is another thing.  Troops new to the
trenches always shoot at nothing the first night.  You
will not do it.  It wastes ammunition and it hurts no
one.  And the enemy says: 'These are new and
nervous troops.'  You will be shelled in the trenches.
When you are shelled, sit low and sit tight.  This
is easy advice, for there is nothing else to do.  If
you get out you will only get it worse.  And if you
go out the Germans will go in.  And if the Germans
go in, we shall counter-attack and put them out; and
that will cost us hundreds of men, instead of the few
whom shells may injure.  The Germans do not like
the bayonet, nor do they support bayonet attacks.
If they get up to you, or if you get up to them, go
right in with the bayonet.  You have the physique
to drive it home.  That you will do it I am sure, and
I do not envy the Germans if you get among them
with the bayonet.
</p>

<p>
"There is one thing more.  My old regiment, the
Royal West Kents, has been here since the beginning
of the war, and it has never lost a trench.  The Army
says, 'The West Kents never budge.'  I am proud
of the great record of my old regiment.  And I think
it is a good omen.  I now belong to you and you
belong to me; and before long the Army will say:
'The Canadians never budge.'  Lads, it can be left
there, and there I leave it.  The Germans will never
turn you out."
</p>

<p>
I may, before concluding the present chapter,
point out that the most severe military critics, both
in England and in France, are loud in their admiration
of the organising power which, in a non-military
country, has produced so fine a force in so short a
time.  In equipment, in all the countless details
which in co-ordination mean efficiency, the Division
holds its own with any division at the war.  This
result was only made possible by labour, zeal, and
immense driving power, and these qualities were
exhibited in Canada at the outbreak of war by all those
whose duties lay in the work of improvisation.

</p>

<p class="sintro">
"During the battle of Neuve Chapelle the Canadians held a part
of the line allotted to the First Army, and, although they were
not actually engaged in the main attack, they rendered valuable
help by keeping the enemy actively employed in front of their
trenches."&mdash;<i>Sir John French's Despatch on the Battle of Neuve
Chapelle, which began on March</i> 10<i>th</i>, 1915.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was night when I left the Canadian Divisional
Headquarters and motored in a southerly direction
towards Neuve Chapelle.  It was the eve of the
great attack, and in the bright space of light cast
by the motor lamps along the road, there came a
kaleidoscopic picture of tramping men.
</p>

<p>
Here at the front there is no need of police
restrictions on motor headlights at night as there
is in London and on English country roads.  The
law under which you place yourself is the range of
the enemy's guns.  Beyond that limit you are free
to turn your headlights on, and there is no danger.
But, once within the range of rifle fire or shell, you
turn your lights on at the peril of your own life.
So you go in darkness.
</p>

<p>
As we rode along with lamps lit, thousands of
khaki-clad men were marching along that
road&mdash;marching steadily in the direction of Neuve
Chapelle.  The endless stream of their faces flashed
along the edge of the <i>pavé</i> in the light of our lamps.
Their ranked figures, dim one moment in the
darkness, sprang for an instant into clear outline as the
light silhouetted them against the background of
the night.  Then they passed out of the light again
and became once more a legion of shadows, marching
towards dawn and Neuve Chapelle.  The tramp
of battalion after battalion was not, however, the
tramp of a shadow army, but the firm, relentless,
indomitable step of armed and trained men.
</p>

<p>
Every now and then there came a cry of "Halt,"
and the columns came on the instant to a stand.
Minutes passed, and the command for the advance
rang out.  The columns moved again.  So it went
on&mdash;halt&mdash;march&mdash;halt&mdash;march&mdash;hour by hour
through the night along that congested road&mdash;a
river of men and guns.
</p>

<p>
For while in one direction men were marching,
in the other direction came batteries of guns, bound
by another route for their position in front of Neuve
Chapelle.  The two streams passed one another&mdash;legions
of men and rumbling, clattering lines of
artillery, all moving under screen of the dark,
towards the line of trenches where the enemy lay.
</p>

<p>
This was no time to risk a block in traffic, and
my motor, swerving off the paved centre of the road,
sank to her axles in the quagmire of thick, sticky
mud at the side.  The guns passed, and we sought
to regain the paved way again, but our wheels spun
round, merely churning dirt.  We could not move
out of that pasty Flemish mud, until a Canadian
ambulance wagon came to our aid.  The unhitched
horses were made fast to the motor, and they heaved
the car out of her clinging bed.
</p>

<p>
In the early morning I came to the cross roads.
The signpost planted at the crossing and pointing
down the road to the south-east bore the inscription
"Six kilometres to Neuve Chapelle."
</p>

<p>
This was the road that the legions had taken.
It led almost in a straight line to the trenches that
were to be stormed, to the village behind them that
was to be captured, and to the town of La Bassée,
a few kilometres further on, strongly held by the
Germans.
</p>

<p>
"Six kilometres to Neuve Chapelle "&mdash;barely four
miles; one hour's easy walking, let us say, on such
a clear, fresh morning; or five minutes in a touring
car if the time had been peace.  But who knew how
many hours of bloody struggle would now be needed
to cover that short level stretch of "Six kilometres
to Neuve Chapelle"!  Between this signpost and
the village towards which it pointed the way, many
thousands of armed men&mdash;sons of the Empire&mdash;had
come from Britain, from India, from all parts
of the Dominions Overseas, to take their share in
driving the wedge down to the end of this six
kilometres of country road, and through the heart of
the German lines.  Here for a moment they paused.
What hopes, what fears, what joys, what sorrows,
triumphs and tragedies were suggested by that
austere signpost, pointing "like Death's lean-lifted
forefinger" down that little stretch of road marked
"Six kilometres to Neuve Chapelle"!
</p>

<p>
I went on foot part of the way here, for so many
battalions of men were massed that motor traffic
was impossible.  These were troops held in reserve.
Those selected for the initial infantry attack were
already in the trenches ahead right and left of the
further end of the road, waiting on the moment of
the advance.
</p>

<p>
I had just passed the signpost when the
comparative peace of morning was awfully
shattered by the united roar and crash of hundreds
of guns.
</p>

<p>
This broke out precisely at half-past seven.  The
exact moment had been fixed beforehand for the
beginning of a cannonade more concentrated and
more terrific than any previous cannonade in the
history of the world.  It continued with extraordinary
violence for half-an-hour, all calibres of guns
taking part in it.  Some of the grandmotherly British
howitzers hurled their enormously destructive shells
into the German lines, on which a hurricane of
shrapnel was descending from a host of smaller
guns.  The German guns and trenches offered little
or no reply, for the enemy were cowering for shelter
from that storm.
</p>

<p>
I turned towards the left and watched for awhile
the good part which the Canadian Artillery played
in that attack.  The Canadian Division, which was
a little further north than Neuve Chapelle, waited
in its trenches, hoping always for the order to
advance.
</p>

<p>
Then I passed down the road until I came to a
minor crossways where a famous general stood in
the midst of his Staff.  Motor despatch riders
dashed up the road, bringing him news of the
progress of the bombardment.  The news was good.
The General awaited the moment when the
cannonade should cease, as suddenly as it had begun,
and he should unleash his troops.
</p>

<p>
Indian infantry marched down the road and
saluted the General as they passed.  He returned
the salute and cried to the officer at the head of the
column, "Good luck."  The officer was an Indian,
who, with a smile, replied in true Oriental fashion:
"Our Division has doubled in strength, General-Sahib,
since it has seen you."
</p>

<p>
While the bombardment continued, British aeroplanes
sailed overhead and crossed over to the German
lines.  The Germans promptly turned some guns
on them.  We saw white ball-puffs of smoke as the
shrapnel shells burst in front, behind, above, below,
and everywhere around the machines, but never near
enough to hit.  They hovered like eagles above the
din of the battle, surveying and reckoning the
damage which our guns inflicted, and reporting
progress.
</p>

<br />
Map&mdash;Line occupied by British in March 1915
</p>

<p>
Once a German Taube rose in the air and lunged
towards the British lines.  Then began a struggle
for the mastery, which goes to the machine which
can mount highest and fire down upon its enemy.
The Taube ringed upwards.  A couple of British
aeroplanes circled after it.  To and fro and round
and round they went, until the end came.  The British
machines secured the upper air, and soon we saw
that the Taube was done.  Probably the pilot had
been wounded.  The machine drooped and swooped
uneasily till, like a wounded bird, it streaked down
headlong far in the distance.
</p>

<p>
I walked over to where a British aeroplane was
about to start on a flight.  The young officer of the
Royal Flying Corps in charge was as cool as though
he were taking a run in a motor-car at home.  "As
a matter of fact," he said, "I wanted change and
rest.  I had spent five months in the trenches, and
was worn out and tired by the everlasting monotony
and drudgery of it all.  So I applied for a job in
the Flying Corps.  It soothes one's nerves to be
up in the air for a bit after living down in the mud
for so long."
</p>

<p>
I watched him soar up into the morning sky and
saw numerous shrapnel bursts chasing him as he
sailed about over the German lines.  What a quiet,
easy-going holiday was this, dodging about in the
air, a clear mark for the enemy's guns!  But, to tell
the truth, the British flying men and machines are
very rarely hit.  Flying in war-time is not so perilous
as it looks, though it needs much skill and a calm,
collected spirit.
</p>

<p>
At length the din of the gunfire ceased, and we
knew that the British troops were rushing from their
trenches to deal with the Germans, whose nerve the
guns had shaken.  Astounded as they had been by
our artillery fire, the Germans were still more amazed
by the rapidity of the infantry attack.  The British
soldiers and the Indians swept in upon them
instantly till large numbers threw down their weapons,
scrambled out of their trenches, and knelt, hands
up, in token of surrender.
</p>

<p>
The fight swept on far beyond the German
trenches, through the village, and beyond that again.
The big guns occasionally joined in, and the chatter
of the machine-guns rose and broke off.  Now the
motor ambulances began to come back&mdash;up that
road down which the finger pointed to Neuve
Chapelle.  They lurched past us as we stood by the
signpost in an intermittent stream, bearing the
wounded men from the fight.
</p>

<p>
Presently the cheerful sight of German prisoners
alternated with the saddening procession of
ambulances.  Large squads of prisoners went by, many
hatless and with dirt-smeared faces, their uniforms
looking as though dipped in mustard, the effect of
the bursting of the British lyddite shells among them
in their trenches.  The dejection of defeat was on
their faces.
</p>

<p>
Some of them were halted and were questioned
by the General.  One man turned out to be a
Frankfort banker, whose chief concern later was what
would become of his money, which he said had been
taken charge of by some of his captors.  He was
also anxious to know where he would be imprisoned,
and seemed relieved, if not delighted, when he
heard that it would be in England.
</p>

<p>
Another prisoner had been a hairdresser in
Dresden.  The General questioned him, and he
gave an entertaining account of his experiences as
a soldier.
</p>

<p>
"I am a Landwehr man," he said.  "I was in
Germany when I was ordered to entrain.  Presently
the train drew up and I was ordered to get out, and
was told I had to go and attack a place called Neuve
Chapelle.  So I went on with others, and soon we
came into a hell of fire, and we ran onwards and
got into a trench, and there the hell was worse than
ever.  We began to fire our rifles.  Suddenly I heard
shouting behind me, and looked round and saw a
large number of Indians between me and the rest
of the German Army.  I then looked at the other
German soldiers in the trench and saw that they
were throwing their rifles out of the trench.  Well,
I am a good German, but I did not want to be
peculiar, so I threw my rifle out also, and then I
was taken prisoner and brought here.  Although I
have not been long at the war, I have had enough
of it.  I never saw daylight in the battlefield until
I was a prisoner."
</p>

<p>
Some of the prisoners were brought along by the
Indian troops who had captured them.  They
complained bitterly that they, Germans, should be
marched about in the custody of Indians!  They
did not understand the grimly humorous reply: "If
the Indians are good enough to take you, they are
good enough to keep you."
</p>

<p>
The Indians smiled with delight, for they are
particularly fond of making prisoners of Germans.
Most of them brought back their little trophies of
the fight, which they held out for inspection with a
smile, crying, "Souvenir!"
</p>

<p>
The stream of prisoners and of wounded
passed on.  The fury of battle relaxed.  Now
and then some of the guns still crashed, but the
machine guns rattled further and further away,
and the crackle of the rifle fire came from a
distance.
</p>

<p>
The British Army had traversed in triumph those
"six kilometres to Neuve Chapelle."
</p>

<p>
At Neuve Chapelle it halted, and there halted,
too, the hopes of an early and conclusive victory for
the Allied forces.
</p>

<p>
The enemy's outposts had been driven in, but
beyond these, their fortified places bristled with
machine guns, which wrought havoc on our troops,
and, indeed, brought the successful offensive to a
close.  Controversy has arisen over the disappointing
results which were achieved.  For a month after the
battle, Neuve Chapelle was heralded by the public
as a great British victory.  But doubt followed
confidence, and in a few weeks the "victory" was
described as a failure.  The truth lies between these
extremes.
</p>

<p>
The object of this battle of Neuve Chapelle was
to give our men a new spirit of offensive and to
test the British fighting machine which had been
built up with so much difficulty on the Western
front.  Besides, if this attack succeeded in destroying
the German lines, it would be possible to gain the
Aubers ridge which dominates Lille.  That ridge
once firmly held in our hands, the city should have
been ours.  That would have been a great victory.
It would probably have meant the end of the
German occupation of this part of France.  In any case
it must have had a marked effect upon the whole
progress of the war.[<a id="chap03fn1text"></a><a href="#chap03fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
That was what we hoped to do.  What we actually
accomplished was the winning of about a mile
of territory along a three-mile front, and the
straightening of our line.  The price was too high
for the result.
</p>

<p>
It was the first great effort ever made by the
British to pierce the German line since it had been
established after the open field battles of the Marne
and the Aisne.  The British troops had faced the
German lines for months, and while the fundamental
principles of the German defences were
fairly well understood, their real strength was very
much underrated.
</p>

<p>
Things went badly from the beginning of the
action.  The artillery "preparation" represented
quite the most formidable bombardment the British
had so far made, but even so, it was ineffective
along certain sections of the line.  After the way
had been paved by shrapnel and high explosive,
the British infantry moved forward in a splendid
offensive to secure what everyone believed would
be a decisive victory; and trained observers of the
battle were under the impression that the gallant
British infantry had won their end.  This is an
impression, too, which was shared by some of the
men for a time.
</p>

<p>
For many months the British had been almost
entirely on the defensive, and over and over again
been called on to repulse heavy, massed German
attacks.  The casualties sustained in repulsing
these attacks first revealed our shortage of machine-guns.
What they lacked in machine-guns, however,
the British troops made up for in a deadly
accuracy of rifle fire, which was at once the terror
and the admiration of the Germans.  The British
had thus come to an exaggerated idea of the efficacy
of rifle fire, and a consequent over-estimate of the
importance of the German first line trenches.  Over
these they swarmed, and the word went forth that
the day was won.
</p>

<p>
It was only when the British troops had occupied
the enemy's first and second line trenches, they
discovered that, in actual fact, they had not done more
than drive in the outposts of an army.  Close at hand,
the Germans' third line loomed up like a succession
of closely interlocked citadels.  Nay, more, those
citadels were so constructed that the trenches from
which our men had ousted the enemy with so much
heroism and loss were deathtraps for the new
tenants.  The circumstances were such that to retire
meant acknowledgment of failure, and to hang on, a
grisly slaughter.
</p>

<p>
Even so, there were features of the situation
which made for hope.  There were positions to be
won which would very seriously jeopardise the
whole German scheme of defence; but, at the
critical moment of the battle, the advanced troops
seem to have passed beyond the control of the
various commanders in the rear on account of the
misty weather.
</p>

<p>
The real tragedy, however, was the non-arrival
of the supports at a point and at a time when the
appearance of reserves might have made all the
difference to the fortunes of the day.  The enemy
was still bewildered and demoralised, and, but for
the delay, might have been completely routed.
Unfortunately, the British front was in great need
of straightening out.  The 23rd Brigade continued
to hang up the 8th Division, while the 25th Brigade
was fighting along a portion of the front where it
was not supposed to be at all.  Units had to be
disentangled and the whole line straightened before
further advance could be made.
</p>

<p>
The fatal result was a delay which, Sir John
French says, would never have occurred had the
"clearly expressed orders of the General Officer
commanding the 1st Army been more carefully observed."
</p>

<p>
Sir Douglas Haig himself hurried up to set things
right, but it was then too late to retrieve the
failure which had been occasioned by delay.  The
attack was thoroughly exhausted, its sting was gone,
and the enemy had pulled himself together.  Night
was falling, and there was nothing to be done but
"dig in" beneath the ridge above Lille, the capture
of which would have altered the whole story of the
campaign on the Western front.
</p>

<p>
As I have said, the Canadian infantry took no
part in the battle, though the troops waited
impatiently and expectantly for the order to advance,
but the activity of the Canadian artillery was
considerable and important.  The Canadian guns took
their full share in the "preparation" for the
subsequent British infantry attack, and the observation
work of our gunners was good and continuous.
</p>

<p>
After Neuve Chapelle, quiet reigned along the
Canadian trenches, though the battle raged to the
north of us at St. Eloi, and the Princess Patricia's
Battalion was involved.  Early in the last days of
March our troops were withdrawn and retired to
rest camps.
</p>

<p>
The Canadians had received their baptism of
fire, and in extremely favourable circumstances.
They had not been called on to make any desperate
attacks on the German lines.  Nor had the
Germans launched any violent assaults upon theirs.
The infantry had sustained a few casualties, but
that was all; while German artillery practice against
our trenches had been curtailed on account of the
violent fighting both to the south and the north.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, we had been surrounded by
all the circumstances of great battles.  We had
watched the passage of the giant guns, of which the
British made use for the first time at Neuve
Chapelle, and we had moved and lived and stood
to arms amid all the stir and accessories of vehement
war.  The guns had boomed their deadly message
in our ears, we had seen death in many forms, and
understood to the full the meaning of "Casualties,"
while, day by day, the aeroplanes wheeled and
circled overhead, passing and re-passing to the
enemy's lines.
</p>

<p>
The Canadians had come to make war, and had
dwelt in the midst of it, and after their turn in the
trenches many of them, no doubt, accounted
themselves war-worn veterans.  Little they knew of the
ordeals of the future.  Little they dreamt, when
towards the middle of the month of April they were
sent to take over French trenches in the Ypres
salient, that they were within a week of that terrible
but wonderful battle which has consecrated this
little corner of Flanders for Canadian generations
yet unborn.

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap03fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap03fn1text">1</a>] The scheme of the attack on Neuve Chapelle had been worked
out by General John Gough just before he was killed, and it was
explained to his Corps Commanders by Sir John French on May
8th as follows:&mdash;The 1st Army was to launch the main assault,
the 4th Corps being on the left flank and the Indian Corps on
the right.  To hold up the enemy all along the line, and to
prevent his massing reinforcements to meet the main attack, two
other supplementary attacks were also to be made&mdash;one attack
by the 1st Corps from Givenchy, and the other by the 3rd
Corps&mdash;detailed from the 2nd Army for that purpose&mdash;to the south of
Armentières.

The fighting in April, in which the Canadians
played so glorious a part, cannot, of course, be
described with precision of military detail until time
has made possible the co-ordination of all the
relevant diaries, and the piecing together in a
narrative both lucid and exact of much which is confused
and blurred.[<a id="chap04fn1text"></a><a href="#chap04fn1">1</a>]

<p>
The battle which raged for so many days in the
neighbourhood of Ypres was bloody, even as men
appraise battles in this callous and life-engulfing
war.  But as long as brave deeds retain the power
to fire the blood of Anglo-Saxons, the stand made
by the Canadians in those desperate days will be
told by fathers to their sons; for in the military
records of Canada this defence will shine as brightly
as, in the records of the British Army, the stubborn
valour with which Sir James Macdonnel and the
Guards beat back from Hougoumont the Division
of Foy and the Army Corps of Reille.
</p>

<p>
The Canadians wrested from the trenches, over
the bodies of the dead and maimed, the right to
stand side by side with the superb troops who, in the
first battle of Ypres, broke and drove before them the
flower of the Prussian Guards.
</p>

<p>
Looked at from any point, the performance would
be remarkable.  It is amazing to soldiers, when the
genesis and composition of the Canadian Division
are considered.  It contained, no doubt, a sprinkling
of South African veterans, but it consisted in the
main of men who were admirable raw material, but
who at the outbreak of war were neither disciplined
nor trained, as men count discipline and training in
these days of scientific warfare.
</p>

<p>
It was, it is true, commanded by a distinguished
English general.  Its staff was supplemented,
without being replaced, by some brilliant British staff
officers.  But in its higher and regimental commands
were to be found lawyers, college professors,
business men, and real estate agents, ready with cool
self-confidence to do battle against an organisation
in which the study of military science is the
exclusive pursuit of laborious lives.  With what
devotion, with a valour how desperate, with resourcefulness
how cool and how fruitful, the amateur soldiers
of Canada confronted overwhelming odds may,
perhaps, be made clear even by a narrative so
incomplete as this.
</p>

<p>
The salient of Ypres has become familiar to all
students of the campaign in Flanders.  Like all
salients, it was, and was known to be, a source of
weakness to the forces holding it; but the reasons
which have led to its retention are apparent, and
need not be explained.
</p>

<p>
On April 22nd the Canadian Division held a line
of, roughly, five thousand yards, extending in a
north-westerly direction from the Ypres-Roulers
railway to the Ypres-Poelcappelle road, and
connecting at its terminus with the French troops.[<a id="chap04fn2text"></a><a href="#chap04fn2">2</a>]  The
Division consisted of three infantry brigades, in
addition to the artillery brigades.  Of the infantry
brigades the first was in reserve, the second was on
the right, and the third established contact with
the Allies at the point indicated above.
</p>

<p>
The day was a peaceful one, warm and sunny,
and except that the previous day had witnessed a
further bombardment of the stricken town of Ypres,[<a id="chap04fn3text"></a><a href="#chap04fn3">3</a>]
everything seemed quiet in front of the Canadian
line.  At five o'clock in the afternoon a plan,
carefully prepared, was put into execution against our
French allies on the left.  Asphyxiating gas of great
intensity was projected into their trenches, probably
by means of force pumps and pipes laid out under
the parapets.
</p>

<p>
The fumes, aided by a favourable wind, floated
backwards, poisoning and disabling over an
extended area those who fell under their effects.  The
result was that the French were compelled to give
ground for a considerable distance.[<a id="chap04fn4text"></a><a href="#chap04fn4">4</a>]  The glory which
the French Army has won in this war would make
it impertinent to labour the compelling nature of
the poisonous discharges under which the trenches
were lost.  The French did, as everyone knew they
would, all that stout soldiers could, and the Canadian
Division, officers and men, look forward to many
occasions in the future in which they will stand side
by side with the brave armies of France.
</p>

<p>
The immediate consequences of this enforced
withdrawal were, of course, extremely grave.  The
3rd Brigade of the Canadian Division was without
any left, or, in other words, its left was "in the
air."  The following rough diagrams may make the
position clear.
</p>

<p>
It became imperatively necessary greatly to
extend the Canadian lines to the left rear.
It was not, of course, practicable to move the
1st Brigade from reserve at a moment's notice,
and the line, extended from 5,000 to 9,000
yards, was naturally not the line that had
been held by the Allies at five o'clock, and a
gap still existed on its left.  The new line, of
which our recent point of contact with the
French formed the apex, ran, quite roughly, as
follows:&mdash;
</p>

Map&mdash;Ypres&mdash;POSITION ON FRIDAY MORNING
</p>

<p>
As shown above, it became necessary for Brigadier-general
Turner (now Major-General), commanding
the 3rd Brigade, to throw back his left flank
southward, to protect his rear.  In the course of the
confusion which followed on the readjustment of the
position, the enemy, who had advanced rapidly after
his initial successes, took four British 4.7 guns, lent
by the 2nd London Division to support the French,
in a small wood to the west of the village of
St. Julien, two miles in the rear of the original French
trenches.
</p>

<p>
The story of the second battle of Ypres is the
story of how the Canadian Division, enormously
outnumbered&mdash;for they had in front of them at least
four divisions, supported by immensely heavy
artillery&mdash;with a gap still existing, though reduced, in
their lines, and with dispositions made hurriedly
under the stimulus of critical danger, fought through
the day and through the night, and then through
another day and night; fought under their officers:
until, as happened to so many, these perished,
gloriously, and then fought from the impulsion of
sheer valour because they came from fighting stock.
</p>

<p>
The enemy, of course, was aware&mdash;whether fully
or not may perhaps be doubted&mdash;of the advantage
his breach in the line had given him, and
immediately began to push a formidable series of attacks
on the whole of the newly-formed Canadian salient.
If it is possible to distinguish, when the attack was
everywhere so fierce, it developed with particular
intensity at this moment on the apex of the
newly-formed line running in the direction of St. Julien.
</p>

<p>
It has already been stated that four British guns
were taken in a wood comparatively early in the
evening of April 22nd.  The General Officer
Commanding the Canadian Division had no intention of
allowing the enemy to retain possession of either the
wood or the guns without a desperate struggle, and
he ordered a counter-attack towards the wood to be
made by the 3rd Infantry Brigade under General
Turner.  This Brigade was then reinforced by the
2nd Battalion under Lieut.-Colonel (now Brigadier-General)
Watson and the 3rd (Toronto) Battalion
under Lieut.-Colonel Rennie (now also a
Brigadier-General), both of the 1st Brigade.  The 7th
Battalion (British Columbia Regiment), from the 2nd
Brigade, had by this time occupied entrenchments
in support of the 3rd Brigade.  The 10th Battalion
of the 2nd Brigade, intercepted on its way up as a
working party, was also placed in support of the
3rd Brigade.
</p>

<p>
The assault upon the wood was launched shortly
after midnight of April 22nd-23rd by the 10th
Battalion and 16th (Canadian Scottish) Battalion,
respectively commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Boyle
and Lieut.-Colonel (now Brigadier-General)
R. G. E. Leckie.  The advance was made under the heaviest
machine gun and rifle fire, the wood was reached,
and, after a desperate struggle by the light of a
misty moon, they took the position at the point of
the bayonet.
</p>

<p>
An officer who took part in the attack describes
how the men about him fell under the fire of the
machine guns, which, in his phrase, played upon
them "like a watering pot."  He added quite
simply, "I wrote my own life off."  But the line
never wavered.
</p>

<p>
When one man fell another took his place, and,
with a final shout, the survivors of the two
Battalions flung themselves into the wood.  The German
garrison was completely demoralised, and the
impetuous advance of the Canadians did not cease
until they reached the far side of the wood and
entrenched themselves there in the position so
dearly gained.  They had, however, the disappointment
of finding that the guns had been destroyed
by the enemy, and later in the same night, a most
formidable concentration of artillery fire, sweeping
the wood as a tropical storm sweeps the leaves from
the trees of a forest, made it impossible for them
to hold the position for which they had sacrificed
so much.

</p>

<p>
Within a few hours of this attack, the
10th Canadian Battalion was again ordered to
advance by Lieut.-Colonel Boyle, late a rancher
in the neighbourhood of Calgary.  The assault
was made upon a German trench which was being
hastily constructed within two hundred yards of
the Battalion's right front.  Machine gun and rifle
fire opened upon the Battalion at the moment the
charge was begun, and Colonel Boyle fell almost
instantly with his left thigh pierced in five places.
Major MacLaren, his second in command, was also
wounded at this time.  Battalion stretcher-bearers
dressed the Colonel's wounds and carried him back
to the Battalion first aid station.  From there he was
moved to Vlamertinghe Field Hospital, and from
there again to Poperinghe.  He was unconscious
when he reached the hospital, and died shortly
afterwards without regaining consciousness.
</p>

<p>
Major MacLaren, already wounded, was killed by
a shell while on his way to the hospital.  The
command of the 10th Battalion passed to Major
D. M. Ormond, who was wounded.  Major Guthrie, a
lawyer from Fredericton, New Brunswick, a member
of the local Parliament and a very resolute soldier,
then took command of the Battalion.
</p>

<p>
The fighting continued without intermission all
through the night of April 22nd-23rd, and to those
who observed the indications that the attack was
being pushed with ever-growing strength, it hardly
seemed possible that the Canadians, fighting in
positions so difficult to defend and so little the subject
of deliberate choice, could maintain their resistance
for any long period.
</p>

<p>
Reinforcements of British troops, commanded by
Colonel Geddes, of the Buffs, began to arrive in the
gap early on Friday morning.  These reinforcements,
consisting of three and a half battalions of the 28th
Division&mdash;drawn from the Buffs, King's Own Royal
Leinsters, Middlesex, and York and Lancasters&mdash;and
other units which joined them from time to time,
became known as Geddes' Detachment.  The
grenadier company of a battalion of the Northumberland
Fusiliers, numbering two officers and 120 men,
who were on their way to rejoin their division after
eight days of trench-fighting at Hill 60, encountered
Colonel Geddes' force and joined it.[<a id="chap04fn5text"></a><a href="#chap04fn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p>
At 6 a.m. on Friday, the 2nd Canadian Brigade
was still intact, but the 3rd Canadian Brigade, on
the left, was bent back upon St. Julien.  It became
apparent that the left was becoming more and more
involved, and a powerful German attempt to outflank
it developed rapidly.  The consequences, if it
had been broken or outflanked, need not be insisted
upon.  They would not have been merely local.
</p>

<p>
It was therefore decided, formidable as the
attempt undoubtedly was, to try to give relief by
a counter-attack upon the first line of German
trenches, now far, far advanced from those originally
occupied by the French.  The attack was carried
out at 6.30 a.m. by the 1st (Ontario) Battalion and
the 4th Battalion of the 1st Brigade, under
Brigadier-General Mercer, acting with Geddes' Detachment.
The 4th Battalion was in advance and the 1st in
support, under the covering fire of the 1st Canadian
Artillery Brigade.
</p>

<p>
It is safe to say that the youngest private in the
ranks, as he set his teeth for the advance, knew the
task in front of him, and the youngest subaltern
knew all that rested on its success.  It did not seem
that any human being could live in the shower of
shot and shell which began to play upon the
advancing troops.
</p>

<p>
They suffered terrible casualties.  For a short time
every other man seemed to fall, but the attack was
pressed ever closer and closer.  The 4th Canadian
Battalion at one moment came under a particularly
withering fire.  For a moment&mdash;not more&mdash;it
wavered.  Its most gallant Commanding Officer,
Lieut.-Colonel Birchall, carrying, after an old
fashion, a light cane, coolly and cheerfully rallied
his men, and at the very moment when his example
had infected them, fell dead at the head of his
Battalion.  With a hoarse cry of anger they sprang
forward (for, indeed, they loved him) as if to avenge
his death.
</p>

<p>
The astonishing attack which followed, pushed
home in the face of direct frontal fire, made in broad
daylight by battalions whose names should live for
ever in the memories of soldiers, was carried to the
first line of the German trenches.  After a hand-to-hand
struggle, the last German who resisted was
bayoneted, and the trench was won.
</p>

<p>
The measure of our success may be taken when
it is pointed out that this trench represented, in the
German advance, the apex in the breach which the
enemy had made in the original line of the Allies,
and that it was two and a half miles south of that
line.  This charge, made by men who looked death
indifferently in the face&mdash;for no man who took part in
it could think that he was likely to live&mdash;saved, and
that was much, the Canadian left.  But it did more.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-059"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-059.jpg" alt="Map--1st Canadian Division situation at 7 a.m. April 23rd, 1915" />
<br />
Map&mdash;1st Canadian Division situation at 7 a.m. April 23rd, 1915
</p>

<p>
Up to the point where the assailants conquered,
or died, it secured and maintained during the most
critical moment of all, the integrity of the Allied line.
For the trench was not only taken&mdash;it was held thereafter
against all comers, and in the teeth of every
conceivable projectile, until the night of Sunday,
April 25th, when all that remained of the war-broken
but victorious battalions was relieved by fresh troops.
</p>

<p>
In this attack, the work of the 1st Artillery Brigade
was extremely efficient.  Under the direction of
Lieut.-Colonel Morrison, whose services have gained
him the command of the artillery of the 2nd Division
with the rank of Brigadier-General, the battery
of four 18-pounders was strengthened, in the afternoon,
with two heavier guns.
</p>

<p>
Captain T. E. Powers, of the Signal Company
attached to General Mercer's command, maintained
communication throughout with the advanced line
of the attack under a heavy shell fire that cut the
signal wires continually.  The work of the Company
was admirable, and was rendered at the price of
many casualties.
</p>

<p>
It is necessary now to return to the fortunes of
the 3rd Brigade, commanded by General Turner,
which, as we have seen, at five o'clock on Thursday
was holding the Canadian left, and after their first
attack assumed the defence of the new Canadian
salient, at the same time sparing all the men it could
to form an extemporised line between the wood and
St. Julien.  This Brigade was also at the first moment
of the German offensive made the object of an attack
by a discharge of poisonous gas.  The discharge
was followed by two enemy assaults.[<a id="chap04fn6text"></a><a href="#chap04fn6">6</a>]
</p>

<p>
Although the fumes were extremely poisonous,
they were not, perhaps, having regard to the wind,
so disabling as on the French lines (which ran almost
east to west), and the Brigade, though affected by the
fumes, stoutly beat back the two German assaults.
Encouraged by this success, it rose to the supreme
effort required by the assault on the wood, which has
already been described.  At 4 a.m. on the morning
of Friday, the 23rd, a fresh emission of gas was
made both on the 2nd Brigade, which held the line
running north-east, and on the 3rd Brigade, which,
as has been fully explained, had continued the line
up to the pivotal point as defined above, and had
there spread down in a south-easterly direction.
</p>

<p>
It is, perhaps, worth mentioning that two privates
of the 48th Highlanders, who found their way into
the trenches commanded by Lieut.-Colonel (now
Brig.-General) Lipsett (90th Winnipeg Rifles), 8th
Battalion, perished in the fumes, and it was noticed
that their faces became blue immediately after
dissolution.  The Royal Highlanders of Montreal, 13th
Battalion, and the 48th Highlanders, 15th Battalion,
were more especially affected by the discharge.  The
Royal Highlanders, though considerably shaken,
remained immovable on their ground.  The 48th
Highlanders, who no doubt received a more poisonous
discharge, were for the moment dismayed, and,
indeed, their trench, according to the testimony of
very hardened soldiers, became intolerable.
</p>

<p>
The Battalion retired from the trench, but for a
very short distance and for a very short time.  In a
few moments they were again their own men.  They
advanced on and reoccupied the trenches which they
had momentarily abandoned.
</p>

<p>
In the course of the same night, the 3rd Brigade,
which had already displayed a resource, a gallantry,
and a tenacity for which no eulogy could be
excessive, was exposed (and with it the whole Allied
cause) to a peril still more formidable.  It has been
explained, and, indeed, the fundamental situation
made the peril clear, that several German divisions
were attempting to crush or drive back this devoted
Brigade, and in any event to use their enormous
numerical superiority to sweep around and overwhelm
its left wing.  At some point in the line which
cannot be precisely determined, the last attempt
partially succeeded, and, in the course of this critical
struggle, German troops in considerable, though not
in overwhelming numbers, swung past the unsupported
left of the Brigade, and, slipping in between
the wood and St. Julien, added to the torturing
anxieties of the long-drawn struggle by the appearance,
and indeed for the moment the reality, of isolation
from the Brigade base.
</p>

<p>
In the exertions made by the 3rd Brigade during
this supreme crisis it is almost impossible to single
out one battalion without injustice to others, but
though the efforts of the Royal Highlanders of
Montreal, 13th Battalion, were only equal to those
of the other battalions who did such heroic service,
it so happened, by chance, that the fate of some of
its officers attracted special attention.
</p>

<p>
Major Norsworthy was in the reserve trenches,
half a mile in the rear of the firing line, when he
was killed in his attempt to reach Major McCuaig
with reinforcements; and Captain Guy Drummond
fell in attempting to rally French troops.  This was
on the afternoon of the 22nd, and the whole
responsibility for coping with the crisis then fell upon the
shoulders of Major McCuaig until he was relieved
early on the morning of the 23rd.
</p>

<p>
All through the afternoon and evening of the
22nd, and all through the night which followed,
McCuaig had to meet and grapple with difficulties
which might have borne down a far more experienced
officer.  His communications had been cut by
shell fire, and he was, therefore, left to decide for
himself whether he should retire or whether he
should hold on.  He decided to hold on, although
he knew that he was without artillery support and
could not hope for any until, at the earliest, the
morning of the 23rd.
</p>

<p>
The decision was a very bold one.  By all the
rules of war McCuaig was a beaten man.  But the
very fact that he remained appears to have deceived
the Germans.  They might have overwhelmed him,
but they feared the supports, which did not in reality
exist.  It was not in the enemy's psychology to
understand that the sheer and unaided valour of
McCuaig and his little force would hold the position.
</p>

<p>
But with a small and dwindling force he did hold
it, until daylight revealed to the enemy the naked
deception of the defence.
</p>

<p>
In case the necessity for retreat developed, the
wounded had been moved to the trenches on the
right; and, under the cover of machine gun fire,
Major McCuaig withdrew his men just as Major
Buchanan came up with reinforcements.
</p>

<p>
The sorely tried Battalion held on for a time in
dug-outs, and, under cover of darkness, retired again
to a new line being formed by reinforcements.  The
rearguard was under Lieut. (now Captain) Greenshields.
But Major McCuaig remained to see that
the wounded were removed.  It was then, after
having escaped a thousand deaths through the long
battle of the night, that he was shot down and made
a prisoner.
</p>

<p>
The story of the officers of the 7th Battalion
(British Columbia Regiment) is not less glorious.
This Battalion was attached to the 3rd Brigade on
Thursday night, and on Friday occupied a position
on the forward crest of a ridge, with its left flank
near St. Julien.  This position was severely shelled
during the day.  In the course of the afternoon the
Battalion received an order to make its position
secure that night.  At half-past four Colonel
Hart-McHarg, a lawyer from Vancouver, Major Odlum
(who is now Lieut.-Colonel commanding the
Battalion), and Lieut. Mathewson, of the Canadian
Engineers, went out to reconnoitre the ground and
decide upon the position of the new trenches to be
dug under cover of darkness.  The exact location
of the German troops immediately opposed to their
position was not known to them.  The reconnoitring
party moved down the slope to the wrecked houses
and shattered walls of the village of Keerselaere&mdash;a
distance of about 300 yards&mdash;in broad daylight
without drawing a shot; but, when they looked through
a window in the rear wall of one of the ruins, they
saw masses of Germans lining hedges not 100 yards
away, and watching them intently.  As the three
Canadian officers were now much nearer the German
line than their own, they turned and began to retire
at the double.  They were followed by a burst of
rapid fire the moment they cleared the shelter of the
ruins.  They instantly threw themselves flat on the
ground.  Colonel Hart-McHarg and Major Odlum
rolled into a shell-hole near by, and Lieut. Mathewson
took cover in a ditch close at hand.  It was then
that Major Odlum learned that his Commanding
Officer was seriously wounded.  Major Odlum
raced up the hill under fire in search of surgical
aid, leaving Lieut. Mathewson with the wounded
officer.  He found Captain George Gibson, medical
officer of the 7th Battalion, who, accompanied
by Sergt. J. Dryden, went down to the shell-hole
immediately.  Captain Gibson and the sergeant
reached the cramped shelter in safety in the face of
a heavy fire.  They moved Colonel Hart-McHarg
into the ditch where Mathewson had first taken
shelter, and there dressed his wound.  They remained
with him until after dark, when the stretcher-bearers
arrived and carried him back to Battalion
Headquarters; but the devotion and heroism of
his friends could not save his life.  The day after
he passed away in a hospital at Poperinghe.[<a id="chap04fn7text"></a><a href="#chap04fn7">7</a>]  But
his regiment endured, and, indeed, throughout
the second battle of Ypres fought greatly
and suffered greatly.  Major Odlum succeeded
Colonel Hart-McHarg.  At one time the Battalion
was flanked, both right and left, by the enemy,
through no fault of its own; and it fell back
when it had been reduced to about 100 men still
able to bear arms.  On the following day, strengthened
by the remnants of the 10th Battalion, the
7th was again sent in to hold a gap in our line,
which duty it performed until, again surrounded
by the enemy, it withdrew under cover of a dense
mist.[<a id="chap04fn8text"></a><a href="#chap04fn8">8</a>][<a id="chap04fn9text"></a><a href="#chap04fn9">9</a>]
</p>

<p>
Every effort was made by General Alderson from
first to last, to reinforce the Canadian Division with
the greatest possible speed, and on Friday afternoon
the left of the Canadian line was strengthened by
the 2nd King's Own Scottish Borderers and the
1st Royal West Kents, of the 13th Infantry Brigade.
From this time forward the Division also received
further assistance on the left from a series of French
counter-attacks pushed in a north-easterly direction
from the canal bank.

<br />
Map&mdash;1st Canadian Division situation at 9 a.m. April 24th 1915
</p>

<p>
But the artillery fire of the enemy continually
grew in intensity, and it became more and more
evident that the Canadian salient could no longer
be maintained against the overwhelming superiority
of numbers by which it was assailed.  Slowly,
stubbornly, and contesting every yard, the defenders
gave ground until the salient gradually receded from
the apex, near the point where it had originally
aligned with the French, and fell back upon
St. Julien.  Soon it became evident that even St. Julien,
exposed to fire from right and left, was no longer
tenable.[<a id="chap04fn10text"></a><a href="#chap04fn10">10</a>]
</p>

<p>
The 3rd Brigade was therefore ordered to retreat
further south, selling every yard of ground as dearly
as it had done since five o'clock on Thursday.  But
it was found impossible, without hazarding far
larger forces, to disentangle detachments of the
Royal Highlanders of Montreal, 13th Battalion, and
of the Royal Montreal Regiment, 14th Battalion.
The Brigade was ordered, and not a moment too
soon, to move back.
</p>

<p>
The retirement left these units with heavy hearts.
The German tide rolled, indeed, over the deserted
village; but for several hours after the enemy had
become master of the village, the sullen and persistent
rifle fire which survived, showed that they were
not yet master of the Canadian rearguard.  If they
died, they died worthily of Canada.
</p>

<p>
The enforced retirement of the 3rd Brigade (and
to have stayed longer would have been madness)
reproduced for the 2nd Brigade, commanded by
Brigadier-General Currie (now Major-General), in
a singularly exact fashion, the position of the 3rd
Brigade itself at the moment of the withdrawal of
the French.  The 2nd Brigade, it must be
remembered, had retained the whole line of trenches,
roughly 2,500 yards, which it was holding at five
o'clock on Thursday afternoon, supported by the
incomparable exertions of the 3rd Brigade, and by
the highly hazardous deployment in which necessity
had involved that Brigade.
</p>

<p>
The 2nd Brigade had maintained its lines.  It
now devolved on General Currie, commanding this
Brigade, to repeat the tactical manoeuvres with which,
earlier in the fight, the 3rd Brigade had adapted
itself to the flank movement of overwhelming
numerical superiority.  He flung his left flank round
south; and his record is that, in the very crisis of this
immense struggle, he held his line of trenches from
Thursday at five o'clock till Sunday afternoon.  And
on Sunday afternoon he had not abandoned his
trenches.  There were none left.  They had been
obliterated by artillery.
</p>

<p>
He withdrew his undefeated troops from the
fragments of his field fortifications, and the hearts
of his men were as completely unbroken as the
parapets of his trenches were completely broken.
In such a Brigade it is invidious to single out any
battalion for special praise, but it is perhaps
necessary to the story to point out that Lieut.-Colonel
Lipsett, commanding the 8th Battalion (90th Winnipeg
Rifles) of the 2nd Brigade, held the extreme
left of the Brigade position at the most critical
moment.
</p>

<p>
The Battalion was expelled from the trenches
early on Friday morning by an emission of poisonous
gas; but, recovering, in three-quarters of an hour it
counter-attacked, retook the trenches it had
abandoned, and bayoneted the enemy.  And after the
3rd Brigade had been forced to retire, Lieut.-Colonel
Lipsett held his position, though his left was in the
air, until two British regiments, 8th Durham Light
Infantry and 1st Hampshires, filled up the gap on
Saturday night.
</p>

<p>
At daybreak on Sunday, April 25th, two companies
of the 8th Battalion (90th Winnipeg Rifles),
holding the left of our line, were relieved by the
Durhams, and retired to reserve trenches.  The
Durhams suffered severely, and at 5 p.m. on Sunday
afternoon, a Company of the 8th Canadian Battalion
took their place on our extreme left.  The Germans
entrenched in the rear of this Company, and German
batteries on the left flank enfiladed it.  The position
became untenable, and the Company was ordered to
evacuate it, two platoons to retire and two platoons
to cover the retirement.  The retiring platoons were
guided back, under terrific fire, by Sergeant (now
Captain) Knobel, with a loss of about 45 per cent. of
their strength.  They joined the Battalion Reserve.
Of the platoons which covered this retirement, every
officer and man was either killed or taken prisoner.
All the officers of the Company who were in action at
the time the retirement was ordered, remained with
the covering platoons.
</p>

<p>
The individual fortunes of the 2nd and 3rd
Brigades have brought us to the events of Sunday
afternoon, but it is necessary, to make the story
complete, to recur for a moment to the events of
the morning.  After a very formidable attack the
enemy succeeded in capturing the village of
St. Julien, which has so often been referred to in
describing the fortunes of the Canadian left.  This
success opened up a new and very menacing line of
advance, but by this time further reinforcements
had arrived.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-071"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-071.jpg" alt="Map--1st Canadian Division situation at noon, April 25th 1915" />
<br />
Map&mdash;1st Canadian Division situation at noon, April 25th 1915
</p>

<p>
Here, again, it became evident that the tactical
necessities of the situation dictated an offensive
movement as the surest method of arresting further
progress.  General Alderson, who was also in
command of the reinforcements, accordingly directed that
an advance should be made by two British brigades
(the 10th Brigade under Brigadier-General Hull,[<a id="chap04fn11text"></a><a href="#chap04fn11">11</a>]
and the Northumberland Brigade), which had been
brought up in support.  The attack was thrust
through the Canadian left and centre; and as the
troops making it swept on, many of them going to
certain death, they paused an instant, and, with
ringing cheers for Canada, gave the first indication
to the Division of the warm admiration which their
exertions had excited in the British Army.[<a id="chap04fn12text"></a><a href="#chap04fn12">12</a>]
</p>

<p>
The advance was indeed costly, but it was made
with a devotion which could not be denied.  The
story is one of which the Brigades may be proud, but
it does not belong to the special account of the
fortunes of the Canadian contingent.  It is sufficient
for our purpose to notice that the attack succeeded
in its object, and the German advance along the line,
momentarily threatened, was arrested.
</p>

<p>
We had reached, in describing the events of the
afternoon, the points at which the trenches of the
2nd Brigade had been completely destroyed.  This
Brigade, the 3rd Brigade, and the considerable
reinforcements which by this time filled the gap
between the two Brigades, were gradually driven,
fighting every yard, upon a line running roughly
from Fortuin, south of St. Julien, in a north-easterly
direction towards Passchendaele.  Here the two
Brigades were relieved by two British brigades, after
exertions as glorious, as fruitful, and, alas! as costly,
as soldiers have ever been called upon to make.
</p>

<p>
Monday morning broke bright and clear and found
the Canadians behind the firing line.  But this day,
too, was to bring its anxieties.  The attack was still
pressed, and it became necessary to ask Brigadier-General
Currie whether he could once more call on
his shrunken Brigade.
</p>

<p>
"The men are tired," this indomitable soldier
replied, "but they are ready and glad to go again
to the trenches."  And so, once more, a hero leading
heroes, the General marched back the men of the
2nd Brigade, reduced to a quarter of its strength,
to the very apex of the line as it existed at that
moment.  The Brigade held this position throughout
Monday; on Tuesday it occupied reserve trenches,
and on Wednesday it was relieved and retired to
billets in the rear.[<a id="chap04fn13text"></a><a href="#chap04fn13">13</a>]
</p>

<p>
It is a fitting climax to the story of the Canadians
at Ypres that the last blows were struck by one who
had borne himself throughout gallantly and
resourcefully.  Lieut.-Colonel Watson, on the evening of
Wednesday, April 28th, was ordered to advance with
his Battalion and dig a line of trenches which were
to link up the French on the left and a battalion of
the Rifle Brigade on the right.  It was both a
difficult and a dangerous task, and Lieut.-Colonel
Watson could only employ two companies to dig,
while two companies acted as cover.
</p>

<p>
They started out at 7 o'clock in the evening from
the field in which they had bivouacked all day west
of Brielen, and made north, towards St. Julien.  And,
even as they started, there was such a hail of
shrapnel, intended either for the farm which served as the
Battalion's Headquarters, or for the road junction
which they would have to cross, that they were
compelled to stand fast.
</p>

<p>
At 8 o'clock, however, Colonel Watson was able
to move on again; and, as the men marched north,
terrible scenes <i>en route</i> showed the fury of the
artillery duel which had been in progress since the
Battalion had moved out of the firing line on the morning
of the 26th.
</p>

<p>
At the bridge crossing Ypres Canal, guides met
the Regiment, and the extraordinary precautions
which were taken to hide its movements indicated
the seriousness of its errand.
</p>

<p>
The Battalion had suffered heavy losses at this
very spot only a few days before, and a draft of five
officers and 112 men from England had reinforced
it only that morning.  And the officers and men of
this draft received an awful baptism of fire within
practically a few hours of their arrival at the front.
High explosives were bursting and thundering;
there were shells searching hedgerows and the
avenue of trees between which the Battalion marched,
and falling in dozens into every scrap of shelter
where the enemy imagined horses or wagons might
be hidden.  Slowly and cautiously, the march continued
until the Battalion arrived behind the first line
trench held by a battalion of the King's Own
Scottish Borderers.  Through this line Colonel Watson
and his men had to pass, and on every side were
strewn the bodies of scores of Ghurkas, the gallant
little soldiers who had that morning perished while
attempting the almost impossible task of advancing
to the assault over nearly 700 yards of open ground.
</p>

<p>
When the Battalion reached the place where the
trenches were to be dug, two companies were led out
by Colonel Watson himself, to act as cover to the
other two companies, which then began digging
along the line marked by the Engineers.  And if
ever men worked with nervous energy, these men
did that night.  From enemy rifles on the ridge
came the ping of bullets, which mercifully passed
overhead, although, judging from the persistency
and multitude of their flares, the enemy must have
known that work was being done.
</p>

<p>
It was two o'clock in the morning before the work
was finished, and the Battalion turned its back
upon about as bad a situation as men have ever
worked in.
</p>

<p>
The return to the billets at Vlamertinghe was
distressing in the extreme.  Officers and men, alike
worn out, slept on the march oblivious of route and
destination.
</p>

<p>
During the night of May 3rd[<a id="chap04fn14text"></a><a href="#chap04fn14">14</a>] and the morning of
the 4th, the 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade withdrew
to billets at Bailleul.  On the night of May 4th
Lieut.-General Alderson handed over the command
of this section of front to the General Officer
Commanding the 4th Division, and removed his
headquarters to Nieppe, withdrawing the 3rd Canadian
Infantry Brigade on the night of the 4th, and the
2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade on the 5th of May.[<a id="chap04fn15text"></a><a href="#chap04fn15">15</a>]
</p>

<p>
Such, in the most general outline, is the story of
a great and glorious feat of arms.  A story told so
soon after the event, while rendering bare justice to
units whose doings fell under the eyes of particular
observers, must do less than justice to others who
played their part&mdash;and all did&mdash;as gloriously as
those whose special activities it is possible, even at
this stage, to describe.  But the friends of men who
fought in other battalions may be content in the
knowledge that they too will learn, when the
historian has achieved the complete correlation of
diaries of all units, the exact part which each played
in these unforgettable days.  It is rather accident
than special distinction which has made it possible
to select individual battalions for mention.
</p>

<p>
It would not be right to close even this account
without a word of tribute to the auxiliary services.
The signallers were always cool and resourceful.
The telegraph and telephone wires were being
constantly cut, and many belonging to this service
rendered up their lives in the discharge of their duty,
carrying out repairs with the most complete calmness
in exposed positions.  The despatch carriers, as
usual, behaved with the greatest bravery.  Theirs is
a lonely life, and very often a lonely death.  One
cycle messenger lay on the ground badly wounded.
He stopped a passing officer and delivered his
message, with some verbal instructions.  These were
coherently given, but he swooned almost before the
words were out of his mouth.
</p>

<p>
The Artillery never flagged in the sleepless
struggle in which so much depended upon its
exertions.  Not a Canadian gun was lost in the long
battle of retreat.  And the nature of the position
renders such a record very remarkable.  One battery
of four guns found itself in such a situation that it
was compelled to turn two of its guns directly about
and fire on the enemy in positions almost diametrically
opposite.
</p>

<p>
The members of the Canadian Engineers, and of
the Canadian Army Medical Corps, rivalled in coolness,
endurance and valour the men of the battalions
who were their comrades.  On more than one
occasion during that long battle of many desperate
engagements, our Engineers held positions, working
with the infantry.  Lieut.-Colonel (now Brigadier-General)
Armstrong commanded our Engineers
throughout the battle.  A fighting force, a constructive
force, and a destructive force in the battle of
Ypres, the Canadian Engineers plied their rifles,
entrenched, and mined bridges across the canal (the
approaches to which they held) in case of final
necessity.
</p>

<p>
No attempt has been made in this description to
explain the recent operations except in so far as
they spring from&mdash;or are connected with&mdash;the
fortunes of the Canadian Division.  The exertions of
the troops who reinforced, and later relieved, the
Canadians, were not less glorious, but the
long-drawn-out struggle is a lesson to the whole
Empire&mdash;"Arise, O Israel!"  The Empire is engaged in a
struggle, without quarter and without compromise,
against an enemy still superbly organised, still
immensely powerful, still confident that its strength
is the mate of its necessities.  To arms, then, and
still to arms!  In Great Britain, in Canada, in
Australia, there is need, and there is need now, of a
community organised alike in military and industrial
co-operation.
</p>

<p>
The graveyard of Canada in Flanders is large.
It is very large.  Those who lie there have left their
mortal remains on alien soil.  To Canada they have
bequeathed their memories and their glory.

[<a href="#chap04fn1text">1</a>] Canadians owe a debt of gratitude to Lt.-Colonel Lamb for
the extreme care and detailed accuracy with which he has
compiled the maps and diaries of the 1st Canadian Division.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap04fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap04fn2text">2</a>] The 2nd and 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigades took over the
line from the French 11th Division on April 17th.  It was perhaps
true that the French had not developed at this part of the line
the elaborate system of support trenches which had been a model
to the British troops in the south.  The Canadians had planned
several supporting points which were in a half-finished state
when the gas attack developed.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap04fn3"></a>
[<a href="#chap04fn3text">3</a>] The great bombardment of Ypres began on April 20th, when
the first 42 centimetre shell fell into the Grand Place of the little
Flemish city.  The only military purpose which the wanton
destruction of Ypres could serve was the blocking of our supply
trains, and on the first day alone 15 children were killed as they
were playing in the streets, while many other civilians perished
in the ruined houses.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap04fn4"></a>
[<a href="#chap04fn4text">4</a>] The French troops, largely made up of Turcos and Zouaves,
surged wildly back over the canal and through the village of
Vlamertinghe just at dark.  The Canadian reserve battalions (of
the 1st Brigade) were amazed at the anguished faces of many
of the French soldiers, twisted and distorted by pain, who were
gasping for breath and vainly trying to gain relief by vomiting.
Traffic in the main streets of the village was demoralised, and
gun-carriages and ammunition wagons added to the confusion.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
The chaos in the main streets of the village was such that any
coherent movement of troops was, for the moment, impossible;
gun-carriages and ammunition wagons were inextricably mixed,
while galloping gun-teams without their guns were careering
wildly in all directions.  When order had been to some extent
restored, Staff Officers learned from fugitives who were in a
condition to speak that the Algerians had left thousands of their
comrades dead and dying along the four-mile gap in our Ally's
lines through which the Germans were pouring behind their gas.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap04fn5"></a>
[<a href="#chap04fn5text">5</a>] Colonel Geddes was killed on the morning of April 28th in
tragic circumstances.  He had done magnificent work with his
composite force, and after five days' terrific fighting received
orders to retire.  He was just leaving his dug-out, after handing
over his command, when a shell ended his career.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap04fn6"></a>
[<a href="#chap04fn6text">6</a>] Although methods for resisting gas attacks were quickly
developed when the need was realised, the Canadians were, of
course, at this time unprovided with the proper means for
withstanding them.  They discovered that a wet handkerchief stuffed
in the mouth gave relief.  To fall back before the gas attack
merely meant that one kept pace with it, while the effort of
running, and the consequent heavy breathing, simply increased the
poison in the lungs.  The Canadians quickly realised that it was
best to face the cloud, and hold on in the hope that the blindness
would be temporary, and the cutting pain would pass away.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap04fn7"></a>
[<a href="#chap04fn7text">7</a>] Col. Hart-McHarg and Col. Boyle&mdash;who fell on the same
day that Col. Hart-McHarg was wounded&mdash;lie in the same burial
ground, the new cemetery at Poperinghe.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap04fn8"></a>
[<a href="#chap04fn8text">8</a>] The losses of the 7th Battalion were heavy even for this time
of heavy losses.  Within a period of less than three days its
colonel was killed and 600 of its officers and men were either
killed or wounded, including every company commander.  Some
companies lost every officer.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap04fn9"></a>
[<a href="#chap04fn9text">9</a>] Lieut. E. D. Bellew, machine-gun officer of the Battalion,
hoisted a loaf stuck on the point of his bayonet, in defiance of
the enemy, which drew upon him a perfect fury of fire; he
fought his gun till it was smashed to atoms, and then continued
to use relays of loaded rifles instead, until he was wounded and
taken prisoner.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap04fn10"></a>
[<a href="#chap04fn10text">10</a>] The remarkable services rendered at St. Julien by the
Commandant, Lt.-Col. Loomis, of the 13th Batt., ought not to be
forgotten.  This officer remained at his post under constant and
very heavy fire until the moment of evacuation, and did much by
the example of his tranquillity to encourage the troops.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap04fn11"></a>
[<a href="#chap04fn11text">11</a>] Brig.-General Hull rendered distinguished services throughout
this trying time.  In addition to his own Brigade&mdash;the 10th&mdash;General
Hull commanded for a considerable period the York and
Durham Brigade, the 2nd King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry,
the 9th Queen Victoria Rifles, the 1st Suffolk Regiment, the 12th
London Regiment, and the 4th Canadian Battalion.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap04fn12"></a>
[<a href="#chap04fn12text">12</a>] The particular objective of the attack was the village of
St. Julien, the wood near by, and the enemy's trenches between these
two points.  Arrangements had been made with the Canadian
Artillery for a preparatory bombardment of the wood, and the
St. Julien trenches, but at the last moment the order to fire on
St. Julien had to be cancelled as it was found that some of the
Canadians were still holding on in the village although completely
surrounded.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap04fn13"></a>
[<a href="#chap04fn13text">13</a>] On the morning of April 26th Lt.-Col. Kemis-Betty, Brigade
Major, and Major Mersereau, Staff Captain, were wounded by a
shell.  Colonel Kemis-Betty, though his wound was serious,
discharged his duty all day.  Major Mersereau, however, who was
grievously injured, was carried into General Currie's dug-out;
and there, as no ambulance was available, he lay till late that
night.  Lt.-Col. Mitchell, of the Canadian Divisional Headquarters
Staff, while on a general reconnaissance, heard of the
plight of the wounded officers, who were badly in need of medical
aid, and he determined to carry them to safety in his own car.
With very great difficulty, for the road was being heavily shelled,
Colonel Mitchell got his motor as far as Fortuin.  The rest of
the way had to be covered on foot, and when General Currie's
dug-out was reached it was found that only Colonel Kemis-Betty
could be moved.  Major Mersereau's injuries were such that he
had to be left in the dug-out until it was practicable to bring up
an ambulance.  Finally, he was removed, and is now in Canada
slowly recovering from his wounds.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap04fn14"></a>
[<a href="#chap04fn14text">14</a>] At 5 o'clock on the afternoon of May 2nd the 1st Canadian
Infantry Brigade moved up in support of the 10th and 12th
Infantry Brigades (British) on account of a gas attack along our
whole front.  The gas enveloped all our trenches except at our
extreme right.  The 10th Infantry Brigade held fast, but the
12th Infantry Brigade was compelled to fall back, for the attack
was so heavy that men were dazed and reeling, and utterly
incapable of any further fighting.  The 1st Canadian Brigade
was not called upon to resist the enemy, but the movements of
the troops show the effects of the gas, and how the men who had
to contend with it contrived to baffle the Germans.  At 5.40 p.m. the
Reserve Battalion of the 12th Infantry Brigade was thrown
into the battle.  In the meantime the General Officer commanding
the 10th Infantry Brigade, observing the troops on his left
retreating, very judiciously sent up the 7th Argyll and Sutherland
Highlanders to occupy the vacated trenches, and arranged with
the 3rd Cavalry Brigade to assist them.  These two units arrived
in time to catch the enemy advancing in the open, and inflicted
severe losses on him.  The manner in which they went through the
gas was worthy of great praise.  Each Company of the 2nd Essex
regiment of the 12th Brigade had one platoon in support about
150 yards in the rear of the first line.  This platoon waited until
the gas had passed the front line trenches, and then, advancing
straight through the gas, occupied the front line trenches in time
to bring heavy fire to bear on the advancing Germans.  Some of
the French infantry closed to the right, thus strengthening the
Essex line, while the French artillery gave an intense and
excellently directed fire, which raked the German lines.  General
Alderson says, "I subsequently wrote to General Joppé thanking
him for this help, and I received a grateful acknowledgment of
my letter."
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap04fn15"></a>
[<a href="#chap04fn15text">15</a>] On General Alderson and the Staff of the 1st Canadian Division
there devolved during the battle the control of 47 Battalions,
2 Cavalry Brigades, Artillery, Engineers, &amp;c.  No greater tribute
can be paid to the resources and energy of the General and of his
Divisional Staff than to record that they handled and fought an
Army adequately and intelligently through one of the longest
and most bitterly-contested battles of the Western War.

<p class="sintro">
"It is by presence of mind in untried emergencies that the
native metal of a man is tested."&mdash;LOWELL.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In a battle of the extent and diversity of Ypres,
there naturally arose innumerable acts of individual
heroism, to which reference could not be made in
the course of the narrative of the engagement
without disturbing its military balance as a whole.
</p>

<p>
I therefore propose to deal with a few of these
incidents now, as they form a record of unsurpassed
valour and tenacity of which every Canadian
must be proud.
</p>

<p>
Quite apart, however, from incidents which occur
in the actual fighting, there is a time immediately
before a battle, and a time immediately after it,
which provide a wealth of human interest too
poignant to be overlooked.  Our vision, narrowed
a little by direct concentration on the progress of
the engagement, and our ears dulled a little by the
din of the conflict, we are prone to overlook the fact
that this war is waged amid scenes only a short time
ago devoted to the various avocations of peace, and
that on the Western Front, especially, the armies of
the Allies are oftentimes inextricably mixed with the
civilian element and the civilian population.
</p>

<p>
A wave of battle is like a wave of the sea.  While
it advances, one is only conscious of its rush and
roar, only concerned to measure how far it may
advance.  As it ebbs, the known landmarks show
again, and we have leisure to gather observations of
comrades who were borne backwards or forwards
on the flood.
</p>

<p>
The wave that fell on us round Ypres has
baptised the Dominion into nationhood&mdash;the mere
written word, "Canada," glows now with a new
meaning before all the civilised world.  Canada has
proved herself, and not unworthily; but those who
survive of the men who have won us our world-right
to pride, are too busy to trouble their heads about
history.  That may come in days of peace.  The
main outlines of the battle have been dealt with
already.  We know what troops took part in it and
how they bore themselves, but the thousand vivid
and intimate episodes, seen between two blasts of
gunfire, or recounted by men met by chance in some
temporary shelter, can never all be told.  Yet they
are too characteristic in their unconsciousness to be
left without an attempt at a record; so I give a little
handful from a great harvest.
</p>

<p>
In the days before the battle, when the Canadians
lived for the most part in and about Sailly, whence
one saw, as I have already written, the German
trench-flares like Northern Lights on the horizon,
Honorary Captain C. T. Costigan, of Calgary, was
the paymaster, and lived, as the paymaster must,
decently remote from the firing line.  Then came the
attack that proved Canada; and the German flares
advanced, and advanced, till they no longer resembled
flickering auroras, but the sizzling electric arc-lights
of a great city.  Captain Costigan locked up his
paychest and abolished his office with the words: "There
is no paymaster."  Next, sinking his rank as
honorary captain, he applied for work in the trenches,
and went off, a second lieutenant of the 10th
Canadians, who needed officers.  He was seen no
more until Monday morning, when he returned to
search for his office, which had been moved to a
cellar at the rear and was, at the moment, in charge
of a sergeant.  But he had only returned to inveigle
some officer with a gift for accounts into the
paymastership.  This arranged, he sped back to his
adopted Battalion.[<a id="chap05fn1text"></a><a href="#chap05fn1">1</a>]  He was not the only one of his
department who served as a combatant on that day.
Honorary Captain McGregor, of British Columbia,
for example, had been paymaster in the Canadian
Scottish, 16th Battalion.  He, too, armed with a cane
and a revolver, went forward at his own desire to
hand-to-hand fighting in the wood where he was
killed, fighting gallantly to the last.
</p>

<p>
The case of Major Guthrie, of New Brunswick,
is somewhat similar.  He was Major of the 12th
Battalion, still in England, but was then at the front
in some legal-military capacity connected with
courts-martial.  He, like Captain Costigan, had asked
the General that Friday morning for a commission
in the sorely tried 10th.  There was some
hesitation, since Guthrie as a major might quite
possibly find himself in command of what was left
of the 10th if, and when, he found it.  "I'll go as
a lieutenant, of course," said he; and as a lieutenant
he went.[<a id="chap05fn2text"></a><a href="#chap05fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p>
The grim practical joking of Fate is illustrated
by the adventures of Major Hercule Barré&mdash;a young
French Canadian who fought well and spoke
English imperfectly.  He had been ordered to get to his
company in haste, and on the way (it was dark) met
some British officers, who promptly declared him a
spy.  The more he protested, the more certain they
were that his speech betrayed him.  So they had him
back to the nearest Headquarters, where he was
identified by a brother officer, and started off
afresh&mdash;only to be held up a second time by some cyclists,
who treated him precisely as the British officers had
done.  Once again he reached Headquarters; once
more the officer, who had identified him before,
guaranteed his good faith; and for the third time
Barré set out.  This time it was a bullet that stopped
him.  He dragged himself to the side of the road
and waited for help.  Someone came at last, and
he hailed.  "Who is it?" said a voice.  "I, Barré!"
he cried.  "What, <i>you</i>, Barré?  What do you want
this time?"  It was the officer who had twice identified
him within the last hour.  "Stretcher-bearers,"
said Barré.  His friend in need summoned a
stretcher-bearer, and Barré was borne off&mdash;to tell the tale
against himself afterwards.
</p>

<p>
There were many others who fell by the way in
the discharge of their duty.  Lieut.-Colonel Currie,
commanding the 48th Highlanders, 15th Battalion,
had his telephone communication with his men in
the trenches cut by shrapnel.  He therefore moved
his Battalion Headquarters into the reserve trenches,
and took with him there a little band of "runners" to
keep him in touch with the Brigade Headquarters, a
couple of miles in the rear.  A "runner" is a man
on foot who, at every risk, must bear the message
entrusted to him to its destination over ground
cross-harrowed by shellfire and, possibly, in the enemy's
occupation.  One such runner was despatched, and
was no more heard of until, days after the battle,
the Lieut.-Colonel received a note from him in
hospital.  It ran: "My dear Colonel Currie,&mdash;I am so
sorry that you will be annoyed with me for not
bringing back a receipt for the message which you sent to
Headquarters by me.  I delivered the message all
right, but on the way back with a receipt, I was hurt
by a shell, and I am taking this first opportunity
of letting you know that the message was delivered.
I am afraid that you will be angry with me.  I am
now in hospital.&mdash;Yours truly, (Sgd.) M. K. Kerr."  It
is characteristic of the Colonel, and our country,
that he should always refer to the private as
M. K. Kerr; and, from the English point of view, equally
characteristic that M. K. Kerr's report should begin:
"My dear Colonel Currie."  And it marks the tone
of the whole Battalion, that only two hundred men
and two officers should have come unscathed out of
the battle.
</p>

<p>
And here is a story of a Brigade Headquarters
that lived in a house surrounded by a moat over
which there was only one road.  On Thursday the
enemy's artillery found the house, and later on, as
the rush came, their rifle fire found it also.  The staff
went on with its work till the end of the week, when
incendiary shells set the place alight and they were
forced to move.  The road being impassable on
account of shrapnel, they swam the moat, but one of
them was badly wounded, and for him swimming
was out of the question.  Captain Scrimger, medical
officer attached to the Royal Montreal Regiment,
protected the wounded man with his own body
against the shrapnel that was coming through the
naked rafters, and carried him out of the blazing
house into the open.[<a id="chap05fn3text"></a><a href="#chap05fn3">3</a>]  Two of the staff, Brig.-General
Hughes (then Brigade Major of the 3rd
Infantry Brigade) and Lieut. Thompson (then
Assistant Adjutant, Royal Montreal Regiment)
reswam the moat and, waiting for a lull in the shell
fire, got the wounded man across the road on to a
stretcher and into a dressing station, after which
they went on with their official duties.
</p>

<p>
On April 24th Colonel Watson, who was editor
of the <i>Quebec Chronicle</i> before he took command
of the 2nd Battalion, was called on to perform as
difficult and dangerous a task as fell to the lot of
any commander during all these difficult and bloody
days.  The operation was most ably carried out, and
Colonel Watson crowned his success, in the midst of
what appeared to be defeat, with a deed of personal
heroism which, but for his rank, would most assuredly
have won for him the Victoria Cross.  It may be said
at once that Colonel Watson proved himself the
bravest of the brave.
</p>

<p>
About noon, the General Officer Commanding the
3rd Brigade telephoned to Colonel Watson to ask
whether, in his opinion, the line of which he was in
charge, could still be held.  Colonel Watson, though
the position was precarious, said that he could still
hold on; and he was then instructed to regard as
cancelled an order which had been telegraphed to
him to retire.
</p>

<p>
Matters, however, grew worse, and at two o'clock
the General Officer Commanding sent Colonel
Watson a peremptory order to fall back at once.
Unfortunately, this message was not received until
about a quarter to three, when the position had
become desperate.
</p>

<p>
The Battalion, apart from many dead, had by this
time upwards of 150 wounded, and the Colonel first
saw to the removal of all these.  Then, leaving his
Battalion Headquarters, he went up to the front line,
in order that he might give, in person, his instructions
to his company commanders to retire.  When he
reached the front line, Colonel Watson made the
most careful dispositions so as to avoid, even at that
terrible moment, any excuse for disorder and undue
haste in the course of the most perilous and intricate
manoeuvre which had now to be carried out.  He
began by sending back all details, such as signallers
and pioneers, and then proceeded to get the
companies out of the trenches, one by one&mdash;first the
company on the left, then the centre company, and,
lastly, the company on the right.
</p>

<p>
It was from the angle of a shattered house, which
had been used as a dressing station, that Colonel
Watson and Colonel Rogers, the second in command
of the Battalion, watched the retirement of the
three companies, together with details of the 14th
Battalion, which had been attached to them since
the morning.  The men were in extended order,
and as they passed the officers the enemy's fire
was very heavy, and men fell like wheat before a
scythe.
</p>

<p>
When the last company was well on its way to
safety, the two officers, after a brief consultation,
decided that it would be best for them to take
separate routes back to the Battalion Headquarters
line.  The reason for this was simple and poignant&mdash;it
increased the chances of one of them getting
through; not, for that matter, that either had very
much hope of escaping the enemy's pitiless fire.
They never expected to see each other again, and
they shook hands in farewell before they dashed out
on their separate ways, which lay through a spray of
bullets and flying shrapnel.  When he had gone
about 300 yards, Colonel Watson paused for a
moment under the cover of a tree to watch the further
retirement of the company he was following.  It was at
this moment that he noticed one of his officers,
Lieut. A. H. Hugill, lying on the ground about sixty yards
to the left, in the direction of the enemy's attack.
Without a moment's hesitation, Colonel Watson went
back to him, thinking that he was wounded; but on
asking him what was the matter, Lieut. Hugill told
him that he had simply been compelled to rest and
recover his breath before he could make another rush.
</p>

<p>
Almost at the same moment, Private Wilson, also
of the 2nd Battalion, was passing near by when he
was shot through the leg.  The man was so close at
hand that Colonel Watson felt impelled to
endeavour to rescue him, and suggested to
Lieut. Hugill that, between them, they might be able to
carry the wounded man back over the eight or nine
hundred yards&mdash;nearly half a mile&mdash;which still
separated them from a place of comparative safety.
Lieut. Hugill immediately agreed, whereupon
Colonel Watson knelt down, and got Wilson on to
his back, and carried him several hundred yards until
the original Battalion Headquarters was reached;
and all the time that Colonel Watson staggered
along with his load the air was alive with bullets,
which drew thicker and thicker, as the enemy was
now rapidly advancing.
</p>

<p>
The various companies had already retired beyond
what had been the Battalion Headquarters, so that
Colonel Watson and Lieut. Hugill had no
opportunity of calling for aid.  They rested for a few
minutes and then started off once more, and between
them they managed to get the wounded private
across the 700 yards of fire-swept ground which still
had to be covered.  But, in spite of the fact that the
ground was ploughed up with shells all round them
during their desperate and heroic retreat, Colonel
Watson and Lieutenant Hugill retrieved their man
in safety.
</p>

<p>
What, again, could be more thrilling than the
story of the dash of Major H. M. Dyer, a farmer
from Manitoba, and Captain (now Lieut.-Col. 25th
Battalion) Edward Hilliam, a fruit farmer
from British Columbia, when in the face of
almost certain death, after the trench telephones
were disabled, they set out to order the retirement of
a battalion on the point of being overwhelmed!
</p>

<p>
It was on April 25th that the position of the
5th Canadian Battalion on the Gravenstafel Ridge
became untenable; but the men in the fire trench did
not entertain any thought of retirement.  The
telephones between Headquarters and the trench were
disabled, the wires having been cut again and again
by the enemy's shell fire.  General Currie saw the
immediate need of sending a positive order to
the Battalion to fall back, and Major Dyer
and Captain Hilliam, both of the 5th Battalion,
undertook to carry up the word to the fire trench.
Each received a copy of the order, for nothing
but a written order signed by their Brigade
Commander would bring the men out.  The two
officers advanced with an interval of about twenty
yards between them, for one or other of them had
to get through.  They were soon on the bald
hill-top, where there were no trenches and no cover of
any description.  Machine gun and rifle fire swept
the ground.  They reached a little patch of mustard,
and laughed to each other at the thought of using
these frail plants as cover.  Still unhit, they reached
a region of shell holes, great and small.  These holes
pitted the ground, irregularly, some being only five
yards apart, others ten or twelve; but to the
officers, each hole in their line of advance
meant a little haven of dead ground, and a brief
breathing space.  So they went forward, scrambling
and dodging in and out of the pits.  When within
100 yards of our trench, Captain Hilliam fell, shot
through the side, and rolled into a ditch.  Major
Dyer went on, and was shot through the chest when
within a few yards of the trench.  He delivered the
message, and what was left of the Battalion fell
back.  Men who went to the ditch to assist Captain
Hilliam, found only a piece of board, on which the
wounded officer had written with clay, "I have
crawled home."  It only remains to add that both
these officers returned to duty with their Battalion
after convalescence.
</p>

<p>
Though these two officers gave a very fine example
of active courage, it would be hard to find a more
remarkable illustration of passive endurance, nobly
borne, than that afforded by Lieut. E. A. Whitehead
on April 24th.  On that day, Captain Victor Currie,
with Lieut. Whitehead and Lieut. (now Captain)
W. D. Adams, was holding a company of the 14th
(Royal Montreal) Battalion, on the salient of which
both flanks were exposed to a merciless fire.  At
5 a.m. that morning, Lieut. Whitehead was shot in the
foot, but he remained in command of his platoon with
the bullet still in his ankle-bone until three o'clock
in the afternoon, when he swooned from pain and
fatigue.  It is sad to record that Sergeant Arundel,
who tried to lift Lieut. Whitehead from the trench,
was shot and instantly killed.
</p>

<p>
On the previous day, the men of No. 2 Company
of the same Battalion had assisted Major (now
Lieut.-Colonel) W. B. M. King, of the Canadian
Field Artillery, to perform one of the most astonishing
and daring feats of the campaign.  With superb
audacity Major King kept his guns in an advanced
position, where he deliberately awaited the approach
of the Germans till they were within 200 yards.
Then, after he had fired his guns into the massed
ranks of the enemy, he succeeded, with the assistance
of the infantry, in getting the guns away.  It
was during the course of this part of the action that
Lance-Corporal Fred Fisher, of the 13th Battalion,
won his V.C., but lost his life.  Being in charge of a
machine gun, he took it forward to cover the
extrication of Major King's battery.  All the four men of
his gun crew were shot down, but he obtained the
services of four men of the 14th Battalion, and
continued to work his gun until the battery was clear.
</p>

<p>
No sooner were Major King's men in safety than
Fisher pushed still further forward to reinforce our
front line, but while getting his men into position
in the face of a combined fire of shrapnel, machine
earns, and rifles, he was shot dead.
</p>

<p>
And here, I would say, that over and above the
pleasure it naturally gives a Canadian to record the
splendid heroism of his fellow-countrymen, the
occasion has provided me with the welcome opportunity
of dissipating a delusion which at the outset
prevailed in England as to the capacity of our
officers.  At the beginning of the war it was a
common saying in the British Army&mdash;I have never
been able to trace the saying to its source&mdash;that the
Canadian troops were the finest in the world, but
that they carried their officers as mascots.
</p>

<p>
Nothing could be further from the truth; and
nothing more ridiculous, as the brilliant records of
the war service of many of these officers amply
proves.  For ingenuity and daring in attack, for skill
and resource in extricating their men from positions
where disaster seemed inevitable, their ability as
regimental officers has only been equalled in this
war by the experienced officers of the first
Expeditionary Force.  As for bravery, for heroic devotion
and self-sacrifice, to compile a full record of their
incomparable deeds, would require a chapter many
times the length of this whole volume.  From
generals down, they have shown the world that, for
sheer valour, Canadian officers can proudly take their
place beside any in the world, while they have
afforded an example and inspiration to their men
which have done much to make the splendid story
of the Canadians in France and Flanders what it is.
</p>

<p>
But if the deeds of the commissioned officers
have been splendid, the exploits of the non-commissioned
officers and men have been not less so.
The narrative of the Division consists of story after
story of coolness in danger, incentive daring,
and unflinching courage which has never been
surpassed.
</p>

<p>
Take, for instance, the story of Sergeant
J. Richardson, of the and Canadian Battalion.  It is a
tale of how shrewd common sense defeated the wiles
of the enemy.  On April 23rd Richardson was on
the extreme left of our line in command of a
half-platoon, when the words, "Lieutenant Scott orders
you to surrender," were passed to him.  He knew
that there were three company commanders in the
line between himself and Lieutenant Scott, and,
therefore, correctly concluded that the order had
nothing to do with any officer of his regiment, but
was of German origin.  He not only ignored the
order, but discredited it with his men by passing
back "No surrender!"  It is impossible to say how
much ground, and how many lives, the sergeant saved
that day by his lively suspicion of German methods,
his quick thought, and his absolute faith in the sense
and courage of his officers.  Sergeant Richardson
belongs to Coburg, Ontario, and is a veteran of the
South African War.
</p>

<p>
Of a different order of courage was Corporal
H. Baker, of the 10th Battalion.  After the attack on the
Wood and the occupation of a part of the German
trench by the 10th Canadian Battalion, on the night of
April 22nd-23rd, Corporal Baker, with sixteen
bomb-throwers, moved to the left along the German line,
bombing the enemy out of the trench.  The
Germans checked Baker's advance with bombs and rifle
fire and put nine of his men out of action during the
night.  The enemy then established a redoubt by
digging a cross-trench.  Corporal Baker and the six
other survivors of his party maintained a position
within ten yards of the redoubt throughout the
remaining hours of the night.  Early in the morning
of the 23rd the Germans received a fresh supply of
bombs and renewed their efforts to dislodge the little
party of Canadians.  They threw over Baker, who
was closer in to their position than the others of his
party, and killed his six companions.  Alone among
the dead, with the menace of death hemming him
in, Baker collected bombs from the still shapes
behind him, and threw them into the enemy's redoubt.
He threw with coolness and accuracy, and slackened
the German fire.  He held his position within ten
yards of the cross-trench all day and all night, and
returned to his Battalion just before the dawn of the
24th, over the bodies of dead and wounded men
who had fallen before the rain of bombs and rifle
grenades.
</p>

<p>
And now we come to the story of two brothers,
Privates N. and J. McIvor, who were stretcher-bearers,
of whom much is expected as a matter of
course.  On April 24th, they were attached to the
5th Battalion (which held a position on the
Gravenstafel Ridge), and carried Major Sanderman, of
their battalion, from the bombarded cross-roads back
to the dressing station over open fire-raked country.
Major Sanderman had been hit by shrapnel, and
died soon after reaching the dressing station.  Four
days later, on April 28th, when the 5th Battalion
was in rear of the Yser Canal, the two McIvors
volunteered to attempt a rescue of the wounded from
the Battalion dressing station beyond Fortuin.  They
discovered the station to be in the enemy's hands,
and J. McIvor was severely wounded.
</p>

<p>
Nor can one dwell without pride on the case of
Company Sergeant-Major F. W. Hall, V.C.  During
the night of April 23rd-24th the 8th Battalion
took over a line of trenches from the 15th Battalion.
Close in rear of the Canadian position at this point
ran a high bank fully exposed to the fire of the
enemy; and while crossing this bank to occupy the
trench, several men of the 8th Battalion were
wounded.  During the early morning of Saturday,
the 24th, Company Sergeant-Major F. W. Hall
brought two of these wounded into the trench.  A
few hours later, at about 9 a.m., groans of suffering
drew attention to another wounded man in the high
ground behind the position.  Corporal Payne went
back for him, but was wounded.  Private Rogerson
next attempted the rescue, and was also wounded.
Then Sergeant-Major Hall made the attempt.  He
reached his objective without accident, though under
heavy fire from the German trenches in front.  This
was deliberate, aimed fire, delivered in broad
daylight.  He managed to get his helpless comrade
into position on his back, but in raising himself a
little to survey the ground over which he had to
return to shelter, he was shot fairly through the head
and instantly killed.  The man for whom he had
given his life was also killed.
</p>

<p>
For this gallant deed Sergeant-Major Hall was
awarded a posthumous V.C.  He was originally
from Belfast, but his Canadian home was in
Winnipeg.  He joined the 8th Battalion at Valcartier,
Quebec, in August, 1914, as a private.
</p>

<p>
Sergeant C. B. Ferris, of the 2nd Field Company
of the Canadian Engineers, proved in the face of
the enemy that he could keep a road repaired faster
than they could destroy it by shell fire.  From
April 25th to the 29th, the road between Fortuin
and the Yser Canal was under the constant
hammer of German shells.  It was of vital
importance to the Canadian and British troops in the
neighbourhood that this road should be kept open
for all manner of transportation, and Captain Irving,
commanding the 2nd Field Company, Canadian
Engineers, sent a party under Sergeant Ferris
and Corporal Rhodes to keep the highway in repair.
Every shell-hole in the road-bed had to be filled
with bricks brought up in wagons from the nearest
ruined houses; and at times it seemed as if the
German artillery would succeed in making new
holes faster than the little party of Canadian
Engineers could fill in the old ones.  Sergeant Ferris
and his men stuck to their task day and night, amid
the dust and splinters and shock of bursting shells,
and their work of reconstruction was more rapid than
the enemy's work of destruction.  They kept the road open.
</p>

<p>
On a moonlit night, a month later, the Roadmender
developed the talents of a Pathfinder, when the 2nd
Field Company of the Canadian Engineers was
ordered to link up a trench in the Canadian front
line with the attempted advance of a British division
on our left, and establish a defensive flank.  A
pre-arranged signal was given, indicating that the
advance had reached, and was holding, a point where
the connection was to be made.  In response, Sapper
Quin attempted to carry through the tape, to mark
the line for digging the linking trench, under a heavy
fire of shells, machine guns, and rifles.  He did not
return, and Sapper Connan went out and failed to
come back; and neither of these men has been seen
or heard of since.  Then Sapper Low made an
attempt to carry the tape across, and failed to return.
Without a moment's hesitation, Sergeant Ferris
sprang over the parapet in the face of the most
severe tire, and, with the tape in one hand and
revolver in the other, cautiously crawled in the
direction of the flaring signal.
</p>

<p>
Midway, he stumbled upon the wire entanglements
of a German redoubt fairly on the line which
his section had thought to dig.  He followed the
wire entanglements of this redoubt completely
round, and for a time was exposed to rifle and
machine gun fire from three sides.  At this moment
he was severely wounded through the lungs, but he
persisted in his effort.  He found out that a mistake
had been made and that the attack had not reached
the point indicated, and staggered back to make his
report, bringing Sapper Low with him.  Sergeant
Ferris's information was eagerly listened to by
Lieut. Matthewson and Sergeant-Major Chetwynd,
who was present as a volunteer.  Sergeant-Major
Chetwynd quickly realised the nature of the
difficulty, and, encouraged by Lieut. Matthewson, he
rallied the detachment and led it to another point
from which he successfully laid the line under very
heavy fire from the German trenches.
</p>

<p>
Now we come to the story of Private Irving, one
of General Turner's subordinate staff, who went out
to do as brave a deed as a man might endeavour,
but never returned.  Irving had been up for
forty-eight hours helping to feed the wounded as they
were brought in to Brigade Headquarters, which had
been turned into a temporary dressing station, when
he heard that a huge poplar tree had fallen across
the road and was holding up the ambulance wagons.
</p>

<p>
Though utterly weary, he at once offered to go
out and cut the tree in pieces and drag it from the
path at the tail of an ambulance wagon.
</p>

<p>
Irving set forth with the ambulance, but, on nearing
the place of which he was in search, left it, an
went forward on foot along the road, which was
being swept by heavy artillery fire and a cross
rifle fire.  And then, even as, axe in hand, he
tramped up this road, with shells bursting all around
him and bullets whistling past him, he disappeared
as completely as though the night had swallowed
him up!  General Turner, who appreciated the
gallant work Irving had set out to do, himself had
all the lists of the Field Force checked over to
see if he had been brought in wounded.  But
Irving was never traced.  He is missing to this
day&mdash;a strange and brave little mystery of this
great war.
</p>

<p>
In another portion of the field Sergeant
W. Swindells, of the 7th Battalion, when all the
company officers had become casualties, and the remnant
of the company left their trench under stress of
terrific fire, rallied them and took them back; but
this again is only one instance in a record for cool
daring which was later built up at Festubert and
Givenchy.  Swindells comes from Kamloops, and
before the war was a rancher on Vancouver Island.
</p>

<p>
Very similar was the action of Sergeant-Major
P. Flinter, of the 2nd Battalion, who displayed
conspicuous gallantry at Langemarck on April 23rd
while in command of a platoon on the left flank of
the Battalion.  This position was under exceptionally
heavy gun and rifle fire, and his pure daring
and bravery were such an inspiration to the men
under his command, that they withstood successfully
all attacks upon them.  He was wounded in the
head, but gallantly cheered his men to renewed
attack.  By fortunate observation he discovered an
enemy bomb depôt in the woods near at hand, and
concentrating all available fire on it, managed to
blow it up.  Throughout his service at the front his
example has been an inspiration to all ranks.
</p>

<p>
It is difficult, where all men were brave, to select
individual cases of extreme courage, but it would
be wrong to close this record without mentioning
Lance-Corporal F.  Williams, of the 3rd Canadian
Battalion, and Private J. K. Young, of the 2nd
Battalion.  On April 25th, near St. Julien, Williams
volunteered to go out with Captain J. H. Lyne-Evans
from the shelter of a farm and bring in
Captain Gerrard Muntz, who lay wounded in a small
hollow several hundred yards away.  The rescue,
which was carried out in broad daylight and in the
midst of a heavy rifle and machine gun fire, was
successful, though Captain Muntz died of his
wounds five days later.  Again, at Festubert, just
a month later, Williams displayed great courage
and resourcefulness in keeping good the wires
for communication between the signal station
and other centres.  The area was under
continuous enemy rifle and shell fire, and the
repairs had to be made under other adverse
conditions.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, the Canadian non-commissioned officers
have proved beyond all doubt their capacity to take
the places of commissioned officers who have been
shot down.
</p>

<p>
Private Young was "mentioned" for handling his
machine gun so well that it was mainly through his
efforts the German attack on the 2nd Battalion was
repulsed on April 24th.  Later, at Givenchy, on
June 15th, he refused to leave his guns even when
he was wounded, and pluckily remained until the
action was over.
</p>

<p>
These are but a few of a hundred other deeds,
done on the spur of the moment, of which there
will never be any memorial except the moment's
cheer or the moment's laughter from those who had
time to observe.  A man can be both heroic and
absurd in the same act, and human nature under
strain always leans to the comic.  What follows is
not at all comic, although it made men laugh at the
time.  In one of the many isolated bits of night
work which had to be undertaken, it happened that
a German detachment was cut off by one of ours
and its situation became hopeless.  There was
something like a gasp as the enemy realised this,
and then a silence broken by a voice crying, in
unmistakable German-American accents, "Have a
heart!"  The detachment had just recovered a
dressing station which had been abandoned a few
hours before, and there they had found the bodies
of their comrades with their wounds dressed&mdash;dead
of fresh wounds by the bayonet!  It is unfortunate
that the Canadians' first serious experience of the
enemy should have included asphyxiation by gas
and the murder of wounded and unconscious men,
because Canadians, more even than the British,
have been accustomed to Germans in their midst,
and till lately have looked upon them as good
citizens.  Now they will tell their children that they
were mistaken, and the end of that war may well be
generations distant.
</p>

<p>
The supply of ammunition and medical attendance
continued unbroken and unconcerned through
all the phases of the Ypres engagement.  The
ammunition columns waited for hour after hour at their
stated points, ready to distribute supplies as needed.
Their business was to stay where they could be
found, and if the shrapnel caught them when lined
up by the roadside, that was part of the business
too.  They stuck it out the livelong days and
nights, coming up full and going away empty with
no more fuss than is made by delivery wagons on
Drummond Street.  The doctors had the distraction
of incessant work, and it was curious to see how
they took their professional manner into the field.
Half the cities and towns in the Dominion might
have identified their own doctors under the official
uniforms as far as they could have seen them.
Though they were working at high pressure, they
were unmistakably the same men.  Some were as
polite as though each poor, mangled case represented
(which it might well have done) the love and hopes
of wealthy and well-known families.  Others
employed the same little phrases of encouragement, and
the same tricks of tone and gesture, at the beginning
and end of their operations, as their hospitals have
known for years.
</p>

<p>
Others, again, switched off from English to
French-Canadian <i>patois</i> as the cases changed under
their hands; but not one of them had a thought to
waste on anything outside the cases.  Their professional
habit seemed to enwrap them like an armoured
belt, to protect them from all consciousness of the
hurricanes of death all round.  This is difficult to
explain to anybody who has not seen a doctor's
face pucker with a slight impatience when one
side of his temporary field ambulance dressing
station is knocked out by the blast of a shell,
and he must wait until someone finds an electric
torch to show him where his patient lies.
It would be inadequate to call such men heroic.
</p>

<p>
Each soul of those engaged&mdash;and Canada threw
in all she had on the ground&mdash;will take away in his
mind pictures that time can never wipe out.  For
some the memory of that struggle in the wood where
the guns were will stand out clearest in the raw
primitiveness of its fighting.  Others will recall only
struggles among rubbish heaps that once were
villages; some wall-end or market square, inestimably
valuable for a few red hours, and then a useless and
disregarded charnel-house.  Very many will think
most of the profiles of bare fields over which men
moved in silence from piles of stacked overcoats and
equipment towards the trench where they knew the
fire was waiting that would sweep them away.  There
was one such attack in which six thousand troops,
of whom not more than a third were Canadians, made
a charge.  Each little company in the space felt
itself alone in the world.  It is so with all bodies
and all individuals in war.  Only when night fell
did the same picture reveal itself to all.  Then it
was war as the prints and pictures in our houses
at home show it&mdash;the horizon lighted all round by
the flame of burning villages, and the German flares
pitching and curving like the comets which are
supposed to attend the death of kings.  Morning light
broke up all the connections, and we were each alone
once more&mdash;horribly visible or hidden.
</p>

<p>
During the bombardment refugees fled back from
the villages while shrapnel fell along the roads they
took.  Amidst all the horrors of this war there was
nothing more heartrending than the misery of these
helpless victims.  They met our supports and
reserves coming up, and pressed aside from the <i>pavés</i>
to give them room.  They had packed what they
could carry on their own backs and the backs of
their horses and cows, while prudent men hired
out dog teams; for one noticed the same busied
dogs passing and repassing up and down the line,
tugging hard in front of the low-wheeled little carts.
Invalids, palsied old men and women swathed in
pillows and bolstered up by the affectionate care of
their middle-aged children, struggled in the procession.
Their fear had overcome their infirmities, and
they had been dragged away swiftly as might be
from that death which Time itself would have dealt
them in a little while.
</p>

<p>
Then, as you know, we buried our dead; the
records began to be made, and the terrible cables
started to work on the list of names for home.  There
is in London a colony of Canadians who have
come across to be a little nearer to their nearest.
They suffer the common lot, and live from hour to
hour in the hotels and lodging-houses, where every
guest and servant is as concerned as they.  Life is
harder for them than for the English, because they
are not among their own surroundings, and France
is very far off.
</p>

<p>
The colony is divided now, as the English have
been since war began, into three classes&mdash;those who
know the worst, those who fear it, and those who for
the time being have escaped any blow, and are
therefore at liberty to help the others.  The cables
from the west are alive with appeals, and as
information is gathered it is flashed back to Canada.  A
voice calls out of a remote township, asking for
news of a certain name.  It has no claim on the
receiver, who may have been, perhaps, his deadly
rival in the little old days.  But it calls, and must
be answered.  Who has had news of this name?
Add it to your list that you carry about and consult
with your friends; and when you have made sure
of your own beloved, in your grief or your joy,
remember to mention this name.  Somebody identifies
it as having come from his own town&mdash;son of
the minister or the lawyer.  He was probably with
comrades from the same neighbourhood, and that at
least will be a clue.  Meantime a soothing cable
must carry the message that inquiries are being
pursued.  There are men in hospitals back from
the trenches who may perhaps recall or remember
him, or be able to refer one to other wounded men.
The unofficial inquiry spreads and ramifies through
all sorts of unofficial channels, till at last some sure
word can be sent of the place of his death, or the
nature of his wound, or the date on which he was
missing, or the moment when he was last seen going
forward.  The voice ceases.  Others take its place&mdash;clear,
curt, businesslike, or, as the broken words tell,
distracted with grief.  The Canadian colony does
its best to deal with them all, and their inquiries cut
across those of the English, and sorrows and griefs
are exchanged.  It is all one family now, so closely
knit by blood that sympathy and service are taken
for granted.  "Your case may be mine to-morrow,"
people say to each other.  "My time, and what
inquiries I can make, are at your disposal if you
will only tell me your need and your name."
</p>

<p>
The grief that we suffer is more new to us than
to the English, who have paid the heavy tolls of
Mons, the retreat, the battle of Neuve Chapelle, and
the first attack on Ypres, and, like ourselves, have
prepared and are preparing men to fill the gaps; but
through their grief and ours runs the unbreakable
pride of a race that has called itself Imperial before
it knew what Empire signified, or had proved itself
within its own memory by long and open-handed
sacrifice.  In that pride we are full partners, and
through the din and confusion of battle Canada
perceives how all that has gone before was but fit
preparation for the destiny upon which she enters
and the history which she opens from this hour.

<p class="sintro">
"In records that defy the tooth of time."&mdash;THE STATESMAN'S
CREED.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
To many minds the battle of Festubert, sometimes
called the battle of Aubers, in which the
Canadians played so gallant and glorious a part,
represents only a vast conflict which raged for a
long period without any definite objective, any
clearly defined line of attack, and with no decisive
result from which clear conclusions can be drawn.
</p>

<p>
This unfortunate impression is largely due to the
fact that it is impossible at the opening of a great
battle for the commander to give any indication of
his intentions; that newspaper correspondents are
debarred from discussing them; and that the official
despatches which reveal the purpose and the plan
of a battle, are only issued when the engagement has
already passed into history and has been lost sight
of among newer feats of arms.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, the battle of Festubert is, in
all its aspects, one of the most clearly defined of the
war, notwithstanding the length of time that it
covered and the numerous and confused individual
and sectional engagements fought along its front.
Its aim was clear, and it was a portion of a definite
scheme on the part of the Allies.  The actual fight
is perfectly easy to follow, and the results are
important, not only from the military point of view
(although in this respect Festubert must be counted
a failure), but from the political changes they
produced in England&mdash;changes designed for the better
conduct of the war.
</p>

<p>
As I have already explained, if we had completely
broken the German lines at the battle of Neuve
Chapelle, we should have gained the Aubers Ridge,
which dominates Lille, the retaking of which would
have completely altered the whole aspect of the war
on the Western front.
</p>

<p>
General Joffre had determined on a great offensive
movement in Artois, in May, for which purpose
he concentrated the most overwhelming artillery
force up to this time assembled in the West.
It was on a par with the terrific masses of
guns with which von Mackensen was, about the
same time, blasting his way through Galicia.  The
French made wonderful progress, and only a few
of the defences of Lens, the key of the whole French
objective, remained in German hands.  But the
Germans were pouring reinforcements into the south,
and it was then that Sir John French, in conjunction
with General Joffre, moved his forces to the attack.
This British offensive was designed to hold up the
German reinforcements destined for Lens, and at
the same time to offer the British a second
opportunity for gaining the Aubers Ridge, from which
Lille and La Bassée could be dominated.  If the
British could gain the ridge, which they hoped
to secure at the battle of Neuve Chapelle, and
if the French could win through to Lens, the
Allies would then be in a position to sweep on
together towards the city which was their common goal.
</p>

<p>
The attack on the German positions began on
May 9th,[<a id="chap06fn1text"></a><a href="#chap06fn1">1</a>] and continued through several days and
nights, and waned, only to be renewed with
redoubled fury on May 16th.  On May 19th, the 2nd
and 7th Divisions, which had suffered very severely,
were withdrawn, and their places taken by the
Canadian Division and the 51st Highland Division
(Territorial).  With the share of the battle which
fell to the lot of the Canadians I will deal in detail
directly.
</p>

<p>
The British attack failed to clear the way to Lille,
which still remains in German hands.  With the
reasons which resulted in our check at Neuve
Chapelle I have already dealt, and it is now
necessary to consider the two principal reasons which
may be assigned for our second failure to secure
the all-important Aubers Ridge.
</p>

<p>
The first reason is definite and explicable.  The
second reason is debatable.
</p>

<p>
At various points along this sector of the front,
and on many occasions, the German lines were
pierced&mdash;pierced but not broken.  Again and again
the British and Canadian troops took the first, the
second, and the third line German trenches.  This
may have destroyed the mathematical precision of
the German line, but it only succeeded in splitting
it up into a series of absolutely impregnable <i>fortins</i>.
It must be remembered that the Germans fought a
defensive battle, and in this they were greatly
assisted by the nature of the ground, which was
dotted with considerable hummocks, cleft with
ravines and indented with chalk pits and quarries,
and was, moreover, abundantly furnished with
pit-heads, mine-works, mills, farms, and the like, all
transformed into miniature fortresses, to approach
which was certain death.  They had constructed
trenches reinforced by concrete-lined galleries, and
linked them up with underground tunnels.  The
battle of the miniature fortresses proved the triumph
of the machine gun.  The Germans employed the
machine gun to an extent which turned even a
pig-stye into a Sebastopol.  Only overwhelming
artillery fire could have shattered this chain of forts,
bound by barbed wire and everywhere covered by
machine guns.
</p>

<p>
Our artillery fire was not sufficient to reduce
them, and the British attack slowly weakened; and
finally the battle died out on the 26th, when Sir John
French gave orders for the curtailment of our
artillery fire.
</p>

<p>
This brings me to the second reason which has
been assigned for our failure to clear the way to
Lille at the battle of Festubert, and that is the
debatable one of "shortage of munitions."
</p>

<p>
The military correspondent of <i>The Times</i>, who
had just returned from the front, affirmed in his
journal on May 14th that the first part of the battle
of Festubert had failed through lack of "high
explosives."
</p>

<p>
The English public was profoundly disturbed at
the failure of an engagement on which it had set
high hopes, and, rightly or wrongly, it fastened on
this accusation of <i>The Times</i> as an indictment of
the Government at home.  Both the Press and the
public settled down with a grim tenacity to discover
what was wrong.  They were alike determined that
the British Army in the future should lack nothing
which it required to achieve success.
</p>

<p>
Amid the hubbub to which <i>The Times</i> disclosure
gave rise, the undercurrent of the reply of officials
at home was never heard, and certainly was never
understood.  Probably the answer of Lord Kitchener
was this: that the requirements of those in command
in the field, based on the calculations of the
artillery experts there, had been faithfully fulfilled so
far as our resources permitted.
</p>

<p>
In any case, Festubert led us to believe that high
explosives must determine the issue of similar battles
in the future, and the outcry in England against the
"shortage of munitions" produced the crisis from
which emerged the Coalition Government.
</p>

<p>
It may therefore be said that the political effects
of Festubert were infinitely greater than its military
results.  The munitions crisis cleared the political
atmosphere and gave England a better understanding
of the difficulties of the war and a steadier
determination to see it through.  It paved the way
for the War Committee, and, finally, for the Allies'
Grand Council of War in Paris.
</p>

<p>
I will now proceed to deal with the battle of
Festubert as it concerns the fortunes of the
Canadians.  The record is a bald one of work in the
trenches by our own people.  It is couched almost
in official phrases, but now and then I have
interpolated some personal anecdote which may help
to show you what triumph and terror and tragedy
lie behind the smooth, impersonal stage directions
of this war.
</p>

<p>
After the second battle of Ypres the Canadian
Division, worn but not shattered, retired into billets
and rested until May 14th, when the Headquarters
moved to the southern section of the British line in
readiness for new operations.  During that time
reinforcements had poured in from the Canadian base
in England, where were gathered the Dominion
troops, whose numbers we owe to the large vision
and untiring energy of the Minister of Militia and
Defence.
</p>

<p>
On May 17th the remade infantry brigades
advanced towards the firing line once more.
</p>

<p>
It must be understood that on the afternoon of
May 18th, the 3rd Brigade occupied reserve trenches,
two companies of the 14th (Royal Montreal)
Battalion, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Meighen,[<a id="chap06fn2text"></a><a href="#chap06fn2">2</a>] and
two companies of the 16th (Canadian Scottish), under
Lieut.-Colonel (now Brig.-General) Leckie, being
ordered to make an immediate advance on La
Quinque Rue, north-west of an Orchard which had
been placed in a state of defence by the enemy.
One company of the 16th Canadian Scottish was
to make a flanking movement on the enemy's position
in the Orchard by way of an old German communicating
trench, and this attack was to be made; of
course, in conjunction with a frontal one.
</p>

<p>
Little time was available to make dispositions,
and as there was no opportunity to reconnoitre the
ground, it was very difficult to determine the proper
objective.  The flanking company of the 16th
Battalion reached its allotted position, but after the
advance of the remaining company of that regiment,
and the 14th, under very heavy shell fire, the proper
direction was not maintained.  The detachments
reached part of their objective, but owing to the lack
of covering fire it was undesirable at the moment
to make an attack on the Orchard.  The companies
were told to dig themselves in and connect up with
the Wiltshire Battalion on their right and the
Coldstream Guards on their left.  They had then gained
500 yards.  Lieut.-Colonel Leckie sent up the other
two companies of the 16th to assist in the digging
and to relieve the original two companies at
daybreak.  During the night the companies of the 14th
Battalion (Royal Montreal) were also withdrawn, and
the trench occupied by these was taken over by
stretching out the Coldstream Guards on one flank
and the 16th Canadian Scottish on the other.[<a id="chap06fn3text"></a><a href="#chap06fn3">3</a>]
</p>

<p>
On the morning of the 20th orders were issued
for an attack on the Orchard that night.  A
reconnaissance of the position was made by Major Leckie,
brother of Lieut.-Colonel Leckie, when patrols were
sent out, one of which very neatly managed to escape
being cut off by the enemy, and another suffered a
few casualties.  This showed the Germans were in
force, and that an attack on the Orchard would be
no light work.  That night the Canadian Scottish
occupied a deserted house close to the German lines,
and succeeded in establishing there two machine
guns and a garrison of thirty men.  The enemy were
evidently not aware that we were in possession of
this house, for although they bombarded all the
British trenches with great severity throughout the
whole of the next day, this little garrison was left
untouched.  The attacking detachment under Major
Rae consisted of two companies of the Canadian
Scottish, one commanded by Captain Morison, the
other by Major Peck.  The attack was to take place
at 7.45 p.m., and at the same time the 15th Battalion
(48th Highlanders) were directed to make an assault
on a position several hundred yards to the right.
During that afternoon the Orchard was very heavily
bombarded by our artillery, the bombardment
increasing in severity up to the delivery of the attack.
Promptly to the minute, the guns ceased, and the
two companies of the 16th Canadians climbed out
of their trenches to advance.  At the same instant
the two machine guns situated in the advanced post
opened on the enemy.  As the advance was carried
out in broad daylight, the movements were at once
seen by the Germans, and immediately a torrent of
machine gun, rifle fire, and shrapnel was directed
upon our troops.  Their steadiness and discipline
were remarkable, and were greatly praised by the
officers of the Coldstream Guards who were on our
left.

Map&mdash;The Orchard and surroundings
</p>

<p>
When they reached the edge of the Orchard an
unexpected obstacle presented itself in the form of
a deep ditch, and on the further side a wired hedge.
Without hesitation, however, the men plunged
through the ditch, in some places up to their necks
in water, and made for previously reconnoitred gaps
in the hedge.  Not many Germans had stayed in
the Orchard during the bombardment.  The bulk of
the garrison, according to the usual German method
under artillery fire, had evidently retired to the
support trenches in the rear.  A few had been left
behind to man a machine gun redoubt near to the
centre of the Orchard with the idea of holding up
our advancing infantry till the enemy, withdrawn
during the bombardment, could return in full
strength; but these machine guns retreated when
the Canadians came.  On the far side of the
Orchard, however, the Germans, following their
system indicated above, came up to contest the
position, but the onset of the Canadians forced them to
beat a hasty retreat.  Although double our numbers,
they could not be induced to face a hand-to-hand
fight.  Three platoons cleared the Orchard, while a
fourth platoon, advancing towards the north side,
were hampered by a very awkward ditch, which
forced them to make a wide detour, so that they did
not reach the Orchard until its occupation was
complete.
</p>

<p>
One company did not enter the Orchard, but
pushed forward and occupied an abandoned German
trench running in a south-westerly direction, to
prevent any flank counter-attack being made by the
enemy.  They then found themselves in a very
exposed position, and consequently suffered heavily.
The casualties, in proportion to the number of men
employed in the attack, were heavy for all engaged,
but the position was a very important one, and had
twice repulsed assault by other regiments.
</p>

<p>
Had our advance been less rapid the enemy would
no doubt have got back into this position, and our
task might have been impossible.  They argued, as
have said, that any attack might be held up by the
machine guns in the redoubt and in the fortified
positions on the flank for long enough to enable
them to return to the Orchard after our bombardment
had ceased, and then throw us back.  The speed
with which our assault was carried out altogether
checkmated this plan.
</p>

<p>
The 16th Battalion (Canadian Scottish) included
detachments from the 72nd Seaforths of Vancouver,
the 79th Camerons of Winnipeg, the 50th Gordons
of Victoria, and the 91st Highlanders of Hamilton;
so all Canada, from Lake Ontario to the Pacific
Ocean, was represented in the Orchard that night.
</p>

<p>
It was in the course of the struggle in the Orchard
that Sapper Harmon, of the 1st Field Company,
C.E., performed one of those exploits which have
made Canadian arms shine in this war.  He was
attached to a party of twelve sappers and fifty
infantrymen of the 3rd Canadian Battalion which
constructed a barricade of sandbags across the road
leading to the Orchard, in the face of heavy fire.
Later, this barricade was partially demolished by a
shell, and Harmon actually repaired it while under
fire from a machine gun only sixty yards away!
Of the party, in whose company Harmon first went
out, six of the twelve sappers were wounded, and of
the fifty infantrymen six were killed and twenty-four
wounded.  Later, he remained in the Orchard
alone for thirty-six hours constructing tunnels under
a hedge, with a view to further operations.  Sapper
B. W. Harmon is a native of Woodstock, New
Brunswick, and a graduate of the University of
New Brunswick.
</p>

<p>
The drawback to drill-book tactics is that if one
side does not keep the rules the other suffers.  And
a citizen army will not keep to the rules.  For
example, not long after the affair of the Orchard, a
Canadian battalion put up a little arrangement with
the ever-adaptable Canadian artillery in its rear.
The artillery opened heavy fire on a section of
German trenches while the battalion made ostentatious
parade of fixing bayonets, rigging trench ladders
and whistling orders, as a prelude to attack the
instant the bombardment should cease.  The
Germans, who are experts in these matters, promptly
retired to their supporting trenches and left the
storm to rage in front, ready to rush forward the
instant it stopped, to meet the Canadian attack.  So
far all went perfectly.  Our guns were lifted from
the front trenches and shelled the supporting trench,
in the manner laid down by the best authorities, to
prevent the Germans coming up.  The Germans
none the less came, and crowded into the front
trenches.  But there was no infantry attack
whatever.  That deceitful Canadian battalion had not
moved.  Only the guns shortened range once more,
and the full blast of their fire fell on the German
front trench, now satisfactorily crowded with men.
Next day's German wireless announced that "a
desperate attack had been heavily repulsed," but
the general sense of the enemy was more accurately
represented by a "hyphenated" voice that cried out
peevishly next evening: "Say, Sam Slick, no dirty
tricks to-night."  But to resume.
</p>

<p>
At seven o'clock in the evening of the 20th the
13th Battalion (Royal Highlanders) of the 3rd
Brigade, under Lieut.-Colonel Loomis, advanced
across the British trenches, under heavy shell fire
and with severe losses, in support of the 16th
Battalion Canadian Scottish.
</p>

<p>
The attack on the Orchard having succeeded,
three companies of the 13th Battalion (Royal
Highlanders) immediately marched forward.  As four
officers of one company, including the officer
commanding, had been severely wounded, the command
was taken over by Major Buchanan, the second in
command of the regiment.
</p>

<p>
A fourth company marched to a support trench
immediately in the rear.  The position was then
consolidated, and the 16th Battalion, after its hard
work and brilliant triumph, withdrew.
</p>

<p>
Next afternoon the enemy in their trenches made
a demonstration fifty yards north of the Orchard,
but our heavy fire soon drove them off the parapets.
During the night the disputed ground between the
trenches was brightly lighted by the enemy's flares
and enlivened by the rattle of continuous musketry.
None the less, our working parties went on with
their improvements and left the position in good
shape for the 3rd (Toronto) Battalion of the 1st
Brigade, which relieved the Royal Highlanders on
Saturday.
</p>

<p>
On the night of May 19th, the 2nd Canadian
Infantry Brigade took over some trenches which had
recently been captured by the 21st Brigade (British),
and also a section of trenches from the 47th
Division.  The 8th and 10th Battalions occupied the
front-line trenches, the 5th Battalion went into
Brigade Reserve, with one company near Festubert,
and three companies bivouacked in the vicinity of
Willow Road; and the 7th Battalion was posted in
Divisional Reserve.
</p>

<p>
On May 20th, at 745 p.m., the 10th Canadian
Battalion, under Major Guthrie, who joined the
Battalion at Ypres as a lieutenant after the regiment
had lost most of its officers, made an attempt to
secure a position known as "Bexhill."  This attack
was a failure, as no previous reconnaissance had
been carried out, and the preliminary bombardment
had been quite ineffectual.  Moreover, our
troops were in full view of the enemy when crossing
a gap in the fire trench, and as the only approach
to "Bexhill" was through an old communicating
trench swept by machine guns, the leading men of
the front company were all shot down and the 10th
Battalion retired.[<a id="chap06fn4text"></a><a href="#chap06fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p>
During the night a further reconnaissance of the
enemy's position was carried out and repairs were
effected in the gap in the fire trenches, which assured
covered communication to all parts of our line.
</p>

<p>
On the evening of May 21st an artillery bombardment
opened under direction of Brigadier-General
Burstall, and went on intermittently until 8.30, when
our attack was launched.  The attacking force
consisted of the grenade company of the 1st Canadian
Brigade and two companies of the 10th Canadian
Battalion.  This attack was met by overwhelming
fire from the "Bexhill" redoubt, and our force on
the left was practically annihilated by machine guns;
indeed, against that steady stream of death no man
could advance.  On the right the attackers succeeded
in reaching the enemy's trench line running south
from "Bexhill," and, preceded by bombers, drove
the enemy 400 paces down the trench and erected a
barricade to hold what they had won.  During the
night the enemy made several attempts to
counterattack, but was successfully repulsed.[<a id="chap06fn5text"></a><a href="#chap06fn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p>
In our attack, which was only partially
successful, Major E. J. Ashton, of Saskatoon, who
was slightly wounded in the head on the previous
night, refused to leave his command.  He was
again wounded, and Privates Swan and Walpole
tried to get him back to safety, and in so doing
Swan was also wounded.  During the same night
Corporal W. R. Brooks, one of the 10th Battalion
snipers, went out from our trench under heavy
fire and brought in two men of the 47th Camerons
who had been lying wounded in the open for three days.
</p>

<p>
At daybreak of May 22nd the enemy opened a
terrific bombardment on the captured trench, which
continued without ceasing through the whole day
and practically wiped the trench out.[<a id="chap06fn6text"></a><a href="#chap06fn6">6</a>]  After very
heavy casualties the southern end of the captured
trench was abandoned, and a second barricade was
erected across the portion that remained in our
hands.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon the enemy's infantry prepared
for an attack, but retired after coming under our
artillery and machine gun fire.  During the night
the trenches were taken over by a detachment of
British troops and a detachment of the 1st Canadian
Infantry Brigade, and by 2nd King Edward's Horse
and Strathcona's Horse.  These latter served, of
course, as infantry, and it was their first introduction
to this war, though Strathcona's Horse took part in
the South African campaign.
</p>

<p>
The 2nd King Edward's Horse took over the
trench held up to that time by the 8th[<a id="chap06fn7text"></a><a href="#chap06fn7">7</a>] Battalion.
On the right of Strathcona's Horse were the Post
Office Rifles, of the 47th Division; but the Post
Office Rifles' machine guns were manned by the
machine gun detachment of the Strathconas.
</p>

<p>
May 23rd passed without incident, although the
enemy threatened an attack upon 2nd King
Edward's Horse, but broke back in the face of a
heavy artillery fire searchingly directed by the
Canadian artillery brigades.[<a id="chap06fn8text"></a><a href="#chap06fn8">8</a>]
</p>

<p>
At 11 p.m. on the night of May 23rd the 5th
Canadian Battalion received orders from the General
Officer Commanding the 2nd Canadian Infantry
Brigade to take the "Bexhill" salient and redoubt,
on which our previous attack had failed.  The force
detailed for the fresh attack then consisted of two
companies of the Battalion, numbering about 500
men, under Major Edgar, together with an additional
100 men furnished by the 7th (British Columbia)
Battalion, divided into two parties&mdash;fifty to construct
bridges before the attack, and fifty to consolidate
whatever positions were gained.  The bridging
party was commanded by Lieut. (now Captain)
R. Murdie, and he took his men out at 2.30 a.m. on the
morning of May 24th.  In bright moonlight, and
under machine gun and rifle fire, he managed to
throw twelve bridges across a ditch 10 ft. in width
and full of water, which lay between our line and
the objective of the attack.  This party naturally
suffered heavy casualties.  The attack itself went
over at 2.45, and in it many of the bridging party
joined; at the same time the battalion bombers under
Lieut. Tozer forced their way up a German
communication trench leading to the redoubt.
Extremely stiff fighting followed, but in the face of
heavy machine gun fire the redoubt was occupied
shortly after four in the morning.  In addition to
the redoubt, the attacking party gained and held
200 yards of trenches to the left of it, and a short
piece to the right, driving the Germans out and back
with heavy losses.
</p>

<p>
"Bexhill" proper, however, had still to be taken,
and to that end the two companies of the 5th Battalion,
which were in reality inadequate to capture so
strong a position, were reinforced by a company from
the 7th Battalion and a squadron of Strathcona's
Horse.[<a id="chap06fn9text"></a><a href="#chap06fn9">9</a>]  With this reinforcement the attack was
immediately pressed home, and "Bexhill" and 130
yards of trenches towards the north fell into our
hands at 5.49 a.m.
</p>

<p>
Further progress, however, was impossible owing
to the unbreakable positions of the enemy.  Forty
minutes later, at about 6.30 a.m., further reinforcements
were received in the form of a platoon from
the 5th Battalion, and with their arrival came orders
to "dig in and hang on," but not to attempt the
taking of any more ground.  It was about this time
that Major Odlum, commanding the 7th Battalion,
took charge of the 5th, as Colonel Tuxford was ill
and Major Edgar had been wounded soon after the
launching of the attack.  The losses among the
officers of Major Edgar's little force had been
terrible.  Major Tenaille and Captain Hopkins, who
commanded the two companies, were killed, as were
also Captains Maikle, Currie, McGee, and Mundell,
while Major Thornton, Captain S. J. Anderson,
Captain Endicott, Major Morris, Lieut. Quinan, and
Lieut. Davis were wounded.  Matters were made
worse by the fact that Major Powley was wounded
just as he came up with his reinforcing company from
the 7th.  All through the morning the enemy's
artillery was exceedingly active, although the Canadian
artillery surrounded our troops, who were holding on
in the redoubt, with a saving ring of shrapnel, and,
at the same time, distracted the enemy's guns with
accurate fire upon their positions.  Canada had good
reason to be proud of her gunners that day.
</p>

<p>
The captured trenches were held all day, but only
at great cost, by the forces which had won them; and
at night the Royal Canadian Dragoons and the 2nd
Battalion of the 1st Brigade arrived, and took them
over.
</p>

<p>
The total losses of the 2nd Brigade amounted to
55 officers and 980 men.
</p>

<p>
The hostile shelling was the most severe that the
Brigade ever experienced, but the ordeal was borne
unshakenly.
</p>

<p>
On the night of May 24th, at 11.30 p.m., while the
troops which had taken "Bexhill" were still hanging
on to what they had won, the 3rd Battalion,
commanded by Lieut.-Colonel (now Brigadier-General)
Rennie, attacked a machine-gun redoubt known as
"The Well," which was a very strongly fortified
position.  The attacking force gained a section of
trench in the position with fine dash; but to take
the redoubt, or to hold their line under the pounding
of bombs and the pitiless fire of the machine guns
in the redoubt, was more than flesh and blood could
accomplish.  To remain would have been to die to a
man&mdash;and win nothing.  This heroic attack was
repulsed with heavy losses.
</p>

<p>
On the following day (May 25th) at noon,
Brigadier-General Seely, M.P., assumed command
of the troops which had won "Bexhill."  General
Seely had already endeared himself to the Canadians
by his personality, and now he was to win their
confidence as a leader in the field.  He arrived at a
perilous and critical moment, and he at once fastened
on the situation with understanding and vigour.  He
remained in command until noon on May 27th, and
through two extremely trying and hazardous days
and nights, displayed soldierly qualities and a gift
for leadership.  Some idea of the severity of the
fighting may be gathered from the fact that the losses
among officers of General Seely's Brigade included,
Lieut. W. G. Tennant, Strathcona's Horse, killed;
Major D. D. Young, Royal Canadian Dragoons,
Major J. A. Hesketh, Strathcona's Horse,
Lieuts. A. D. Cameron, D. C. McDonald, J. A. Sparkes,
Strathcona's Horse, Major C. Harding and
Lieuts. C. Brook and R. C. Everett, 2nd King Edward's
Horse, wounded.  The casualties in other ranks,
killed, wounded, and missing, were also very heavy.
</p>

<p>
An inspiring feature of the fighting at this
particular period was the dash, gallantry, and steadiness
of the regiments of horse which, to relieve the terrible
pressure of the moment, were called on to serve as
infantry, without any fighting experience, and flung
into the forefront of a desperate and bloody battle.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to record all the acts of heroism
performed by officers and men, but the narrative
would be incomplete without a few of them.
</p>

<p>
Major Arthur Cecil Murray, M.P., of 2nd King
Edward's Horse, for instance, distinguished himself
by the determined and gallant manner in which he
led his squadron, held his ground, and worked at the
construction of a parapet under heavy machine gun
fire.  The considerable advance made on the left of
the position was in a large measure due to his efforts.
Lieut. (now Captain) J. A. Critchley, of Strathcona's
Horse, armed with bombs, led his men in the assault
on an enemy machine gun redoubt with notable
spirit.  Corporal W. Legge, of the Royal Canadian
Dragoons, went out on the night of May 25th and
located a German machine gun which had been
causing us heavy losses during the day, and so
enabled his regiment to silence it with converging fire.
</p>

<p>
It was on May 25th, too, that Sergeant Morris, of
2nd King Edward's Horse, accompanied the Brigade
grenade company, who were sent to assist the Post
Office Rifles of the 47th London Division in an
attack on a certain position on the evening of that day.
</p>

<p>
Morris led the attack down the German communication
trench, and all the members of his party,
with the exception of himself, were either killed or
wounded.  He got to a point at the end of the trench
and there maintained himself&mdash;to use the cold official
phrase&mdash;by throwing bombs and by the work of his
single rifle and bayonet.  By fighting single-handed
he managed to hold out until the extreme left of the
Post Office Rifles came up to his relief.
</p>

<p>
On the following day, the 26th, Corporal Pym,
Royal Canadian Dragoons, exhibited a self-sacrifice
and contempt for danger which can seldom have
been excelled on any battlefield.  Hearing cries for
help in English between the British and German
lines, which were only sixty yards apart, he resolved
to go in search of the sufferer.  The space between
the lines was swept with incessant rifle and machine
gun fire, but Pym crept out and found the man, who
had been wounded in both thigh-bones and had been
lying there for three days and nights.  Pym was
unable to move him without causing him pain which
he was not in a state to bear.  Pym therefore called
back to the trench for help, and Sergeant Hollowell,
Royal Canadian Dragoons, crept out and joined him,
but was shot dead just as he reached Pym and the
wounded man.
</p>

<p>
Pym thereupon crept back across the fire-swept
space to see if he could get a stretcher, but having
regained the trench he came to the conclusion that
the ground was too rough to drag the stretcher across it.
</p>

<p>
Once more, therefore, he recrossed the deadly
space between the trenches, and at last, with the
utmost difficulty, brought the wounded man in alive.
</p>

<p>
Those were days of splendid deeds, and this
chapter cannot be closed without recording the most
splendid of all&mdash;that of Sergeant Hickey, of the
4th Canadian Battalion,[<a id="chap06fn10text"></a><a href="#chap06fn10">10</a>] which won for him the
recommendation for the Victoria Cross.  Hickey had
joined the Battalion at Valcartier from the 36th Peel
Regiment, and on May 24th he volunteered to go
out and recover two trench mortars belonging to the
Battalion which had been abandoned in a ditch the
previous day.  The excursion promised Hickey
certain death, but he seemed to consider that rather an
inducement than a deterrent.  After perilous adventures
under hells of fire he found the mortars and
brought them in.  But he also found what was of
infinitely greater value&mdash;the shortest and safest route
by which to bring up men from the reserve trenches
to the firing line.  It was a discovery which saved
many lives at a moment when every life was of the
greatest value, and time and time again, at the risk
of his own as he went back and forth, he guided
party after party up to the trenches by this route.
</p>

<p>
Hickey's devotion to duty had been remarkable
throughout, and at Pilckem Ridge, on April 23rd, he
had voluntarily run forward in front of the line to
assist five wounded comrades.  How he survived the
shell and rifle fire which the enemy, who had an
uninterrupted view of his heroic efforts, did not scruple
to turn upon him, it is impossible to say: but he
succeeded in dressing the wounds of all the five and
conveying them back to cover.
</p>

<p>
Hickey, who was a cheery and a modest soul, and
as brave as any of our brave Canadians, did not live
to receive the honour for which he had been
recommended.  On May 30th a stray bullet hit him in the
neck and killed him.  And so there went home to
the God of Battles a man to whom battle had been joy.
</p>

<p>
On May 31st the Canadian Division was withdrawn
from the territory it had seized from the enemy
and moved to the extreme south of the British line.
Here the routine of ordinary trench warfare was
resumed until the middle of June.[<a id="chap06fn11text"></a><a href="#chap06fn11">11</a>]
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap06fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap06fn1text">1</a>] The detailed plan of the engagement was as follows:&mdash;Sir
Herbert Plumer with the 2nd Army was to protect Ypres while
the 3rd Corps held Armentières.  The 1st Army under Sir Douglas
Haig was to carry the entrenchments and redoubts on the right
of the Crown Prince Rupprecht's Army.  Sir John French had
arranged for the 4th Corps to attack the German position at
Rouges-Bancs, to the north-west of Fromelles.  The 1st Corps
and the Indian Corps were first to occupy the plain between
Neuve Chapelle and Givenchy, and afterwards take the Aubers
Ridge.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap06fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap06fn2text">2</a>] Lt.-Colonel Meighen led his troops with capacity and
judgment.  He had already won distinction at Ypres.  In accordance
with the English custom of recalling men who have acquired
experience in the field for training purposes at home, Colonel
Meighen has been sent to Canada, and given charge of the
instructional scheme of the Canadian Forces from the Atlantic to the
Pacific, with the temporary rank of Brigadier-General.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap06fn3"></a>
[<a href="#chap06fn3text">3</a>] Our men were very anxious to get to grips with the enemy
on this day (May 18th), as it was the birthday of Prince
Rupprecht of Bavaria, who had issued an order that no prisoners
were to be taken.  Some idea of the efforts made to incite the
enemy's forces to further outrages against the conventions of war
may be gathered from the following paragraph extracted from the
<i>Lille War News</i>, an official journal issued to the German
troops:&mdash;"Comrades, if the enemy were to invade our land, do you think
he would leave one stone upon another of our fathers' houses, our
churches, and all the works of a thousand years of love and
toil? ... and if your strong arms did not hold back the English (God
damn them!) and the French (God annihilate them!) do you think
they would spare your homes and your loved ones?  What would
these pirates from the Isles do to you if they were to set foot
on German soil?"
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap06fn4"></a>
[<a href="#chap06fn4text">4</a>] The casualties of the 10th Battalion during the fighting in
April and May were 809.  The casualties at Ypres alone were 600
of all ranks.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap06fn5"></a>
[<a href="#chap06fn5text">5</a>] Coy. Sergt.-Major G. R. Turner (now Lieutenant), of the 3rd
Field Company, Canadian Engineers, who served with courage
and coolness throughout the second battle of Ypres, and particularly
distinguished himself on the nights of April 22nd and 27th
by bringing in wounded under severe artillery and rifle fire, again
attracted the attention of his superior officers by his courageous
conduct at Festubert.  From May 18th to 22nd he was in
command of detachments of sappers employed in digging advanced
lines of trenches, and generally constructing defences.  This work
was carried through most efficiently, although under fire from
field guns, machine guns, and rifles.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap06fn6"></a>
[<a href="#chap06fn6text">6</a>] It was during this bombardment that Captain McMeans,
Lieut. Smith-Rewse, and Lieut. Passmore were killed, and
Lieut. Denison was wounded.
The fate of Captain McMeans was particularly
regrettable as he had on all occasions borne himself most
gallantly.  Such was the force of his example that, when he
himself, and all the other officers, as well as half the men of the
Company, had been killed or wounded, the remainder clung
doggedly to the position.  The conduct of Captain J. M. Prower
also calls for mention.  He was wounded, but returned to his
command as soon as his wounds were dressed, and though again
buried under the parapet, continued to do his duty.  He is now
Brigade Major of the 2nd Infantry Brigade.  On the same day
Coy. Sergt.-Major John Hay steadied and most ably controlled
the men of his Company after all the officers and 70 men out of
the 140 had been put out of action.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap06fn7"></a>
[<a href="#chap06fn7text">7</a>] <i>Casualties of 8th Battalion</i>.&mdash;About 90 per cent. of the original
officers and men of the 8th Battalion have been casualties.  Only
three of the original officers of the battalion have escaped wounds
or death.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap06fn8"></a>
[<a href="#chap06fn8text">8</a>] This was an attack made by the 7th Prussian Army Corps
which had been very strongly reinforced.  The German efforts
to break through the Canadian lines were very determined, and
they advanced in masses, which, however, melted away before
our fire.
</p>

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Between the close of the battle of Festubert, on
May 26th, and the beginning of the great conflict at
Loos, on September 25th, there was a series of
minor engagements along the whole British front, in
which Givenchy stands out as another red milestone
on Canada's road to glory.
</p>

<p>
The brief mention of Givenchy in the official
despatch in which Sir John French reviewed the
operations of the British Army between Festubert
and Loos, conveys no idea of the desperate fury or
the scope of the fighting in which the Canadians
again did all, and more than all, that was asked of
them.
</p>

<p>
That in the end they were forced to fall back from
the fortified positions they had won with so much
heroism and at so much cost, was due to difficulties
in other portions of the field, which prevented the
7th British Division from coming up in time.
</p>

<p>
Givenchy may appear but an incident in a long chain
of operations when one is taking a bird's-eye view of
the campaign on the Western Front as a whole, but
it was in reality a very considerable and sanguinary
battle, the story of which should appeal to every
Canadian heart.
</p>

<p>
The 7th British Division had been directed to
make a frontal attack on a fortified place in the
enemy's entrenched position known to our troops as
"Stony Mountain," and the 1st Canadian (Ontario)
Battalion, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Hill, of
the 1st Brigade, was detailed to secure the right
flank of the British Division by seizing two lines of
German trenches extending from "Stony Mountain"
150 yards south to another fortified point known to
us as "Dorchester."  Working parties from the 2nd
and 3rd Canadian Battalions were detailed to secure
the lines of trenches taken by the 1st Battalion, to
connect these with our trenches, and finally to form
the defensive flank wherever it might be required.
</p>

<p>
After a few days of preparation the 1st Canadian
Battalion (Ontario Regiment) moved up, and at three
o'clock on the afternoon of June 15th, the Battalion
reached our line of trenches opposite the position
to be attacked, when the 2nd Canadian Battalion,
under Lieut.-Colonel Watson, which was holding the
trench position, withdrew to the right to make room
for them.
</p>

<p>
The trench line on the right of the attacking
Battalion was held by the 2nd and 4th Canadian Battalions
as far as the La Bassée Canal, with the 3rd Canadian
Toronto Regiment in support.  The left was held
by the East Yorks.
</p>

<br />
Map&mdash;ATTACK MADE BY 1ST CANADIAN BATTALION JUNE 15TH 1915
</p>

<p>
From three o'clock until six in the evening, the
Ontario Regiment awaited the command to charge,
and sung their chosen songs&mdash;all popular but all
unprintable.  The enemy bombarded our position
heartily, though our artillery had the better of them.
Fifteen minutes before the attack was timed to take
place, two 18-pounder guns, which had been placed
in the infantry trenches under the cover of
darkness on the instructions of Brigadier-General
Burstall, opened fire upon the parapets of the enemy
trenches.  One gun, under Lieut. C. S. Craig, fired
over 100 rounds, sweeping the ground clear of wire
and destroying two machine-guns.  Lieut. Craig, who
was wounded at Ypres early in May and again while
observing near Givenchy, was seriously wounded
after completing his task here.  Lieut. L. S. Kelly,
who was in command of the other gun, succeeded in
destroying a machine-gun, when his own gun was
wrecked by an enemy shell, and he was wounded.
The gun shields themselves were tattered and twisted
like paper by the mere force of musketry fire.[<a id="chap07fn1text"></a><a href="#chap07fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
Just before six o'clock a mine, previously prepared
by the sappers, was exploded.  Owing to the discovery
of water under the German trenches, its tunnel
could not be carried far enough forward, and the
Canadian troops had accordingly been withdrawn
from a salient in the Canadian line, known as
"Duck's Bill," to guard against casualties in our own
trenches, when it went off.  However, to make sure
that the explosion would reach the German line, so
heavy a charge had to be used that the effects upon
the Canadian trench line were somewhat serious.
Several of our own bombers were killed and
wounded, and a reserve depôt of bombs was buried
under the <i>débris</i>.  Another bomb-depôt was blown
up by an enemy shell about this time.  These two
accidents made us short of bombs when we needed
them later on, and we had to rely entirely on the
supply of bombs which the bombers carried themselves.
</p>

<p>
Lieut.-Colonel Beecher, second in command, who
escaped injury from the first explosion in our trench,
was killed by a splinter from a high explosive shell
at this moment.
</p>

<p>
The leading company, under Major G. J. L. Smith,
rushed forward, with the smoke and flying
dirt of the mine explosion for a screen, and met
a withering fire from the German machine-guns
placed in "Stony Mountain."  But their dash was
irresistible, and almost immediately the company
was in possession of the German front trench and
"Dorchester"; but those who were opposite to
"Stony Mountain" were stopped by fire from that
fort, all being killed or wounded.
</p>

<p>
The leading company was followed by bombing
parties on the right and left flanks, and by a blocking
party of eight sappers of the 1st Field Company
Canadian Engineers.  Lieut. C. A. James, who was
in charge of the right bombing party, was killed at
the time of the explosion of the mine.  Those who
remained advanced without a leader.  Lieut. G. N. Gordon,
in charge of the bomb party on the left,
advanced in die direction of "Stony Mountain,"
but his bombers were almost all shot down.  A few
reached the first-line trench, including
Lieut. Gordon.  He was soon wounded, and was afterwards
killed by a German bomb party while lying in the
German first-line trench with two other comrades
who had exhausted their supply of bombs.  They
were almost the only survivors of the bombing
party.  The members of the blocking party,
too, had all been killed or wounded, save
Sapper Harmon, who, being unable to follow
his vocation single-handed, loaded himself with
bombs which he hurriedly collected from the dead
and dying and wounded bombers and set out to
bomb his way along the trench alone.  He retired,
with ten bullet wounds in his body, only after he
had thrown his last bomb.
</p>

<p>
The second company, under Captain G. L. Wilkinson,
at once followed the leading company
and the bombers, and both companies charged
forward to the second-line trench, where the enemy
presented a firm front, although stragglers were
retreating through the tall grass in the rear.  The
bombers went to work from right to left to clear the
trench.  Many resisting Germans were bayoneted,
and some prisoners were taken and sent back, and
later, with some of their escort, were killed by
machine-gun and rifle fire from "Stony Mountain"
itself.
</p>

<p>
Captain Wilkinson's company was followed
almost immediately by the third company under
Lieut. T. C. Sims, as the other company officers,
Captain F. W. Robinson and Lieut. P. W. Pick,
had been killed by a shell at the moment
our mine blew up.  This company began to consolidate
the first-line German trench which had been
captured&mdash;that is to say, it reversed the sandbag
parapet and turned the trench facing enemy-wards.
It had suffered heavily in its advance across the
open space between the opposing lines, and
Captain Delamere's company was the fourth sent forward
to support.  Captain Delamere had been wounded
and the command devolved upon Lieut. J. C. L. Young,
who was wounded at our parapet.  Lieut. Tranter
took command, and was killed in a moment.
Company-Sergeant-Major Owen then assumed
command, and led the company with bravery and good
sense.
</p>

<p>
Lieut. F. W. Campbell, with two machine-guns,
had advanced in the rear of Captain Wilkinson's
company.  The entire crew of one gun was killed
or wounded in the advance, but a portion of the
other crew gained the enemy's front trench, and
then advanced along the trench in the direction of
"Stony Mountain."  The advance was most difficult,
and, although subjected to constant heavy rifle
and machine-gun fire, the bombers led the way
until further advance was impossible owing to a
barricade across the trench which had been hurriedly
erected by the enemy.  The bomb and the machine-gun
bear the brunt of the day's work more and more
as time goes on, till one almost begins to think that
the rifle may come to be superseded by the shot-gun.
The machine-gun crew which reached the trench was
reduced to Lieut. Campbell and Private Vincent (a
lumberjack from Bracebridge, Ontario), the
machine-gun and the tripod.  In default of a base,
Lieut. Campbell set up the machine-gun on the broad back
of Private Vincent and fired continuously.  Afterwards,
during the retreat, German bombers entered
the trench, and Lieut. Campbell fell wounded.
Private Vincent then cut away the cartridge belt,
and, abandoning the tripod, dragged the gun away
to safety because it was too hot to handle.
Lieut. Campbell crawled out of the enemy trench, and was
carried into our trench in a dying condition by
Company-Sergeant-Major Owen.  In the words of
Kinglake, "And no man died that night with
more glory, yet many died and there was much glory."
</p>

<p>
The working parties detailed for the construction
of the line adjoining our trenches with the hostile
line which had been captured, moved out according
to arrangement, but the heavy machine-gun fire from
"Stony Mountain" forced them back to the cover
of our trench, and all further attempts to continue
work while daylight lasted came to nothing.  The
efforts of the Battalion were now confined to erecting
barricades just south of "Stony Mountain" and north
of "Dorchester," and to holding the second-line
trench.
</p>

<p>
The supply of bombs ran short, and Private
Smith, of Southampton, Ontario, son of a Methodist
Minister, and not much more than nineteen, was
almost the only source of replenishment.  He was,
till Armageddon, a student at the Listowell
Business College.  History relates he was singing the
trench version of "I wonder how the old folks are
at home," when the mine exploded and he was
buried.  By the time he had dug himself out he
discovered that all his world, including his rifle, had
disappeared.  But his business training told him
that there was an active demand for bombs for the
German trenches a few score yards away.  So
Private Smith festooned himself with bombs from
dead and wounded bomb-throwers around him, and
set out, mainly on all-fours, to supply that demand.
He did it five times.  He was not himself a
bomb-thrower but a mere middleman.  Twice he went up
to the trenches and handed over his load to the busy
men.  Thrice, so hot was the fire, that he had to lie
down and toss the bombs (they do not explode till
the safety pin is withdrawn) into the trench to the
men who needed them most.  His clothes were
literally shot into rags and ravels, but he himself
was untouched in all his hazardous speculations, and
he explains his escape by saying, "I kept moving."
</p>

<p>
So through all these hells the spirit of man
endured and rejoiced, indomitable.
</p>

<p>
But, after all, the supply of bombs ran out, and
the casualties resulting from heavy machine-gun and
rifle fire from "Stony Mountain" considerably
increased the difficulties of holding the line.  The
bombers could fight no more.  One unknown
wounded man was seen standing on the parapet of
the German front-line trench.  He had thrown every
bomb he carried, and, weeping with rage, continued
to hurl bricks and stones at the advancing enemy
till his end came.
</p>

<p>
Every effort was made to clear out the wounded,
and reinforcements from the 3rd Battalion were sent
forward.[<a id="chap07fn2text"></a><a href="#chap07fn2">2</a>]  But still no work could be done, and a
further supply of bombs was not yet available.
Bombs were absolutely necessary.  At one point
four volunteers who went to get more were killed,
one after the other; upon that, Sergeant Kranz,
of London, England, by way of Vermillion,
Alberta, and at one time a private of the Argyll and
Sutherland Regiment, went back, and, fortunately,
returned with a load.  He was followed by Sergeant
Newell, a cheese-maker from Watford, near Sarnia,
and Sergeant-Major Cuddy, a druggist from
Strathroy.  Gradually our men in the second German line
were forced back along the German communication
trench, and the loss of practically all of our officers
hampered the fight.  The volunteers who were bringing
forward a supply of bombs were nearly all killed,
and the supply died out with them.
</p>

<p>
The British Division had been unable to advance
on the left owing to the strength of the fortified
position at "Stony Mountain," and the German line
north of that fort.  The Canadians held their
ground, however, hoping for the ultimate success
of the attack on the left, in the face of heavy
pressure on their exposed left flank.
</p>

<p>
The enemy meanwhile had been accumulating
strong forces, and finally, at about half-past nine, the
remnants of the Battalion were forced to evacuate
all the ground that had been gained.  The withdrawal
was conducted with deliberation, through a
hail of bullets, but it cost us heavily.
</p>

<p>
One splendid incident among many may perhaps
explain the reason.  Private Gledhill is eighteen
years of age.  His grandfather owns a woollen mill
in Ben Miller, near Goderich, Ontario.  Ben Miller
was, till lately, celebrated as the home of the fattest
man in the world, for there lived Mr. Jonathan
Miller, who weighed 400 lbs., and moved about in a
special carriage of his own.  Private Gledhill,
destined perhaps to confer fresh fame on Ben Miller,
saw Germans advancing down the trench; saw also
that only three Canadians were left in the trench,
two with the machine-gun, and himself, as he said,
"running a rifle."  Before he had time to observe
more, an invader's bomb most literally gave him a
lift home, and landed him uninjured outside the
trench with his rifle broken.  He found another rifle
and fired awhile from the knee till it became
necessary to join the retreat.  During that manoeuvre,
which required caution, he fell over Lieut. Brown
wounded, and offered to convoy him home.
"Thanks, no," said the lieutenant, "I can crawl."  Then
Private Frank Ullock, late a livery stable
keeper at Chatham, New Brunswick, but now with
one leg missing, said, "Will you take <i>me</i>?"  "Sure,"
replied Gledhill.  But Frank Ullock is a heavy man
and could not well be lifted.  So Gledhill got down
on hands and knees, and Ullock took good hold of
his web equipment and was hauled gingerly along
the ground towards the home trench.  Presently
Gledhill left Ullock under some cover while he
crawled forward, cut a strand of wire from our
entanglements and threw the looped end back, lassoo
fashion, to Ullock, who wrapped it round his body.
Gledhill then hauled him to the parapet, where the
stretcher-bearers came out and took charge.  All
this, of course, from first to last and at every pace,
under a tempest of fire.  It is pleasant to think that
Frank Ullock fell to the charge of Dr. Murray
Maclaren, also of New Brunswick, who watched over
him with tender care in a hospital under canvas, of
1,080 beds&mdash;a hospital that is larger than the
General, the Royal Victoria, and the Western of
Montreal combined.  Gledhill was not touched, and
in spite of his experiences prefers life at the front to
work in his grandfather's woollen mills at Ben
Miller, near Goderich, Ontario.
</p>

<p>
Out of twenty-three combatant officers who went
into this action only three missed death or wounding.
They are Colonel Hill, who fought his men to the
bitter end with high judgment and courage;
Lieut. S. A. Creighton and Lieut. (now Captain)
T. C. Sims, who did their work soldierly and well.
</p>

<p>
Although the whole plan of attack was prepared
by the Corps Commander, the operations of the 1st
Canadian Battalion (Ontario Regiment) were
brilliantly directed by General Mercer, who commanded
the Brigade.  He is a man of mature years, a
philosopher by nature and a lawyer by profession, always
calm and even-tempered, and not given to too many
words.
</p>

<p>
For twenty-five years he took an active part in
Canadian Militia affairs, and the 2nd Queen's Own
of Toronto held him in high esteem as their
Commanding Officer.
</p>

<p>
As a soldier, in the face of the enemy, he has
gained vast experience since he set foot in France,
But, in addition, he has the inestimable possession
of shrewd common sense, great courage, and an
instinctive knowledge of military operations.  There
can be no finer tribute to his personality than the
respect and affection of the men about him.
</p>

<p>
On the day following the attack, a wounded man
was seen lying in the open between the British and
the German lines.  Lance-Corporal E. A. Barrett,
of the 4th Battalion, and at one time the steward of
the Edmonton Club, at once went out in broad daylight
under heavy shell and rifle fire and brought the
wounded man in.
</p>

<p>
Two days later, on the 18th, Private G. F. Clark,
of the 8th Battalion (Winnipeg Rifles), displayed
even greater coolness and daring.
</p>

<p>
About midday, in the neighbourhood of "Duck's
Bill," Lieut. E. H. Houghton, of Winnipeg, machine-gun
officer of the 8th Battalion, saw a wounded British
soldier lying near the German trench.  As soon as
dusk fell he and Private Clark, of the machine-gun
section, dug a hole in the parapet, through which
Clark went out and brought in the wounded man,
who proved to be a private of the East Yorks.  The
trenches at this point were only thirty-five yards
apart.  Private Clark had received a bullet through
his cap during his rescue of the wounded Englishman,
but he crawled through the hole in the parapet
again and went after a Canadian machine-gun which
had been abandoned within a few yards of the
German trench during the recent attack.  He brought
the gun safely into our trench, and the tripod to
within a few feet of our parapet.  He wished to keep
the gun to add to the battery of his own section, but
the General Officer Commanding ruled that it was
to be returned to its original battalion, and promised
Clark something in its place which he would find
less awkward to carry.  Private Clark comes from
Port Arthur, Ontario, and, before the war, earned his
living by working in the lumber-woods.
</p>

<p>
After several days of heavy artillery fire our troops
were relieved and the Headquarters moved to the
north.  Here a trench line was taken over from a
British Division.
</p>

<p>
When Dominion Day came they remembered with
pride that they were the Army of a Nation, and
those who were in the trenches displayed the
Dominion flag, decorated with the flowers of France,
to the annoyance of the barbarians, who riddled it
with bullets.  Behind the lines the Day was
celebrated with sports and games, while the pipers of the
Scottish Canadian Battalions played a "selection of
National Airs."
</p>

<p>
But the shouting baseball teams and minstrel
shows, with their outrageous personal allusions, the
skirl of the pipes and the choruses of the well-known
ragtimes, moved men to the depths of their souls.
For this was the first Dominion Day that Canada
had spent with the red sword in her hand.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap07fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap07fn1text">1</a>] On June 12th the 4th Battery, Canadian Field Artillery,
commanded by Major Geo. H. Ralston, received orders to place two
guns in our front-line trench, at "Duck's Bill," and to have
them dug in and protected by sandbags by the morning of the
15th.  The German trench was only 75 yards away at this point,
and the purpose of the two guns was to cut wire, level parapets,
and destroy machine-gun emplacements on a front of 200 yards.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
The positions for the field guns in our trench were ready by
the night of the 14th, and at 9.30 of the same night the two guns,
their wheels muffled with old motor tyres, left the battery's
position near the canal, and, in charge of Captain Stockwell and
Sergeant-Major Kerry, passed through Givenchy.  At this point
the horses were unhooked, and the guns were hauled to their
places in our front-line trench by hand.  Shells were also drawn
in by hand, in small armoured wagons.  The guns were protected
by one-quarter-inch armour plate, and their crews remained with
them throughout the night.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
The Right Section gun was commanded by Lieut. C. S. Craig,
with Sergeant Miller as No. 1, and the Left Section gun by
Lieut. L. S. Kelly, with Sergeant E. G. MacDougall as No. 1.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
On the afternoon of the 15th, the batteries of the Division
commenced firing on certain selected points of the enemy's front.  At
5.45 the infantry, working to the minute on advance orders,
knocked down our parapet in front of the two entrenched guns
and so uncovered their field of fire.  The guns opened fire
instantly on the German position, and by six o'clock had disposed
of six machine-gun emplacements, levelled the German parapets
and cut the wire to pieces.  Our infantry attacked immediately
after the firing of the last shot, and just as the German batteries
began to range on our two guns.  A shell burst over and behind
the Right Section gun, killing three of its crew and wounding
Lieut. Craig and Corporal King, who died of his wounds.
Lieut. Kelly was wounded a few minutes later.  Sergeant MacDougall
found Lieut. Craig lying helpless among the dead and wounded,
and carried him back to a dressing station.  Later, the Right
Section gun was smashed by a direct hit.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
Sergeant MacDougall, who comes from Moncton, New Brunswick,
and is a graduate of McGill University in Electrical
Engineering, again did valuable work on the following night in
removing the two guns from the trench back to safety.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap07fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap07fn2text">2</a>] The 3rd (Toronto) Battalion has now only five of its original
officers serving with it; 85 officers have been on the strength of

<p>
On Sunday, August 23rd, 1914, on a grey and
gloomy day, immense numbers of people assembled
in Lansdowne Park, in the City of Ottawa, to attend
divine service with the Princess Patricia's Canadian
Light Infantry, and to witness the presentation to
the Battalion of the Colours which she had worked
with her own hand.  The Regiment, composed very
largely of South African Veterans and Reservists,
paraded with bands and pipers, and then formed
three sides of a square in front of the grand stand.
Between the Regiment and the stand were the
Duchess of Connaught, Princess Patricia, and their
Ladies-in-Waiting.  The Princess Patricia, on
presenting the Colours to Colonel Farquhar, the
Commanding Officer of the Regiment, said: "I have
great pleasure in presenting you with these Colours
which I have worked myself; I hope they will be
associated with what I believe will be a
distinguished corps; I shall follow the fortunes of you
all with the deepest interest, and I heartily wish
every man good luck and a safe return."
</p>

<p>
Not even the good wishes of this beautiful and
gracious Princess have availed to safeguard the
lives of the splendid Battalion which carried her
Colours to the battlefields of Flanders; but every
member of the Battalion resolved, as simply and
as finely as the knights of mediæval days, that he
would justify the belief in its future so proudly
expressed by the lady whose name he was honoured
to bear.
</p>

<p>
It is now intended to give some account of the
fortunes of the Battalion since the day, which seems
so long ago, when with all the pride and circumstance
of military display, it received the regimental
colours amid the cheers of the citizens of Ottawa.
</p>

<p>
The Princess Patricias, containing a far larger
proportion of experienced soldiers than any other
unit in the Canadian Division, was not called upon
to endure so long a period of preparation as the rest
of the Canadian Expeditionary Force; and at the
close of the year 1914 they sailed from England at
a moment when reinforcements were greatly needed
in France, to strengthen the 80th Brigade of the
27th Division, and to take their part in a line thinly
held and very fiercely assailed.  For the months of
January and February the Regiment took its turn
in the trenches, learning the hard lessons of the
unpitying winter war.  A considerable length of
trenches in front of the village of St. Eloi was
committed to its charge.  Its machine-guns were
planted upon a mound which rose abruptly from
the centre of the trenches.
</p>

<p>
The early days were uneventful and the casualties
not more than normal, although some very valuable
officers were lost.  On February 28th, 1915, the
Germans completed a sap, from which the Battalion
became constantly subject to annoyance, danger,
and loss.  It was therefore determined by the
Battalion Commander to dispose of the menace.  Major
Hamilton Gault and Lieut. Colquhoun carried out
by night a dangerous reconnaissance of the German
position, and returned with much information.
Lieut. Colquhoun went out a second time, alone, to
supplement it, but never returned.  He is to-day
a prisoner of war in Germany.
</p>

<p>
The attack was organised under Lieut. Crabbe;
the bomb-throwers were commanded by Lieut. Papineau.
The last-named officer, a very brave
soldier, is a lineal descendant of the rebel of 1837.
He is himself loyal to his family traditions except
when dangers and wars menace the Empire.  At
such moments, in spite of himself, his hand flies to
the sword.  The snipers were under Corporal Ross.
Troops were organised in support with shovels
ready to demolish the parapet of the enemy trench.
The ground to be traversed was short enough, for
the sappers' nearest point was only fifteen yards
from the Canadian trench.  The attacking party
rushed this space and threw themselves into the sap.
Corporal Ross, who was first in the race, was killed
immediately.  Lieut. Crabbe then led the
detachment down the trench while Lieut. Papineau ran
down the outside of the parapet throwing bombs
into the trench.  Lieut. Crabbe made his way
through the trench, followed by his men, until his
progress was arrested by a barrier which the
Germans had constructed.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, troops had occupied the rear
face of the sap to guard against a counter-attack.
A platoon under Sergeant-Major Lloyd, who was
killed, attacked and demolished the enemy parapet
for a considerable distance.  The trench was
occupied long enough to complete the work of
demolishing the parapet.  With dawn, orders were given
for the attackers to withdraw, and as the grey
morning light began to break, they made their way
to their own trenches, with a difficult task well and
successfully performed.  Major Gault was wounded
in the course of the engagement, in which all ranks
behaved with dash and gallantry, although the men
had been for six weeks employed in trench warfare
under the most depressing conditions of cold and
damp.
</p>

<p>
On March 1st the enemy made a vigorous attack
on the Princess Patricias with bombs and shell fire.
Between the 1st and the 6th, a fierce contest was
continually waged for the site of the sap which the
Battalion had destroyed.  Sometimes the Princess
Patricias defended it; sometimes the British
battalions, with whom they were brigaded and whose
staunch and faithful comrades they had become.
</p>

<p>
On March 6th, carrying out a carefully concerted
plan, our men withdrew from the trench lines, which
were still only twenty or thirty yards from the
German trenches; and our artillery, making very
successful practice, obliterated the sap and the
trench which the enemy had used for the purpose
of creating it.  The enemy were blown out of the
forward trenches, and fragments of dead Germans
were thrown into the air, in some cases as high as
sixty feet.  The bombardment was carried out with
high explosive shells.
</p>

<p>
The Canadian soldier is always adaptable, and
the Battalion learned, when they captured the sap
on February 28th, that the German trenches were
five feet deep with parapets two feet high, and yet
that every day they were pumped and kept dry.
This knowledge resulted in a considerable
improvement in the trenches occupied by the Regiment.
The experience was welcome, for the men had been
standing in water all through the winter months and
the Regiment had suffered much from frostbite.
</p>

<p>
On March 13th, while the Princess Patricias were
in billets, the Germans, perhaps in reply to our
offensive at Neuve Chapelle, made a vigorous attack
in overwhelming numbers upon the trenches and
mound at St. Eloi.  The attack, which was preceded
by a heavy artillery bombardment, was successful,
and it became necessary to attempt by a counterattack
to arrest any further development.
</p>

<p>
The Battalion was billeted in Westoutre, where, at
5.30 on March 14th, peremptory orders were received
to prepare for departure.  At 7 p.m. the march was
begun.  At Zevecoten the Princess Patricias met a
battalion of the King's Royal Rifle Corps, and
marched to Dickebush.  At 9.30 it reached the cross
roads of Kruistraathoek.  Here a short halt was made,
after which the Battalion reached Voormezeele,
where it was drawn up on the roadside.  While it
was in this position reports were brought in that
the Germans were advancing in large numbers
towards the eastern end of Voormezeele.  The
Battalion Commander, therefore, as a precaution against
surprise, detailed Number 4 Company of the
Battalion to occupy the position on the east.  Soon
after 2 a.m. orders were received to co-operate with
a battalion of the Rifle Brigade in an attack on the
St. Eloi mound, which had been lost early in the
day.  The zone of the operations of the Battalion
was to the east of the Voormezeele-Warneton road.
</p>

<p>
The following rough diagram may make the
position clear:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-149"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-149.jpg" alt="Map--the Voormezeele-St. Eloi area" />
<br />
Map&mdash;the Voormezeele-St. Eloi area
</p>

<p>
The actual situation in the front line was still
obscure.  It was known that the mound and certain
trenches to the west of it, were in German hands.
It was also known that towards the east we had lost
certain trenches known to our Intelligence Staff as
P and A.  It was uncertain whether the trench T
was still held by our troops.  It was decided, in a
matter in which certainty was unattainable, to
proceed towards a farm building which was an easily
recognised objective.  This course at least promised
information, for if trench T had fallen it was certain
that the Battalion would at once be heavily attacked.
If it was still intact the Battalion would, it was
hoped, cover the commencement of an assault along
the German line against trenches A and P and the
mound, successively.
</p>

<p>
The alternative was to advance southwards with
the Battalion right on the Ypres-St. Eloi road.  The
adoption of this plan would have meant slow progress
through the enclosures round St. Eloi, and the
subsequent attack would have been exposed to heavy
flanking fire from trenches A and P.
</p>

<p>
The progress of the Battalion was necessarily
slow; the street in Voormezeele was full of stragglers.
Touch was difficult to maintain across country without
constant short halts.  It was necessary always to
advance with a screen of scouts thrown out.
</p>

<p>
It was ascertained in St. Eloi that trench A had
been retaken by British troops.  This knowledge
modified the plan provisionally adopted.  The
Battalion altered its objective from the farm building
to a breastwork 200 yards to the west of it.  This
point was reached about twenty minutes before
daylight, and an attack was immediately organised by
Number 2 Company against trench P, approaching
it from the back of trench A.  The attack was made
in three parties.
</p>

<p>
The advance was made with coolness and resolution,
but the attackers were met by heavy machine-gun
fire from the mound.  No soldiers in the world
could have forced their way through, for the fire
swept everything before it.  It was clear that no
hope of a surprise existed, and to have spent
another company upon reinforcement would have
been a useless and bloody sacrifice.  Three platoons
were, therefore, detailed to hold the right of the
breastwork in immediate proximity to the mound,
and the rest of the Battalion was withdrawn to
Voormezeele, reaching Dickebush about 8 a.m.[<a id="chap08fn1text"></a><a href="#chap08fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
The forces engaged behaved with great steadiness
throughout a trying and unsuccessful night,
and at daylight withdrew over open ground without
Voormezeele, reaching Dickebush about 8 a.m.
</p>

<p>
On March 20th the Battalion sustained a severe
loss in the death, by a stray bullet, of its
Commanding Officer, Colonel Farquhar.  He had been
Military Secretary to the Duke of Connaught.  This
distinguished officer had done more for the
Battalion than it would be possible in a short chapter
to record.  The Regiment, in fact, was his creation.
A strict disciplinarian, he was nevertheless deeply
beloved in an army not always patient of discipline
tactlessly asserted; he was always cheerful, always
unruffled, and always resourceful.  Lieut.-Colonel
H. C. Buller succeeded him in command of the
Regiment.
</p>

<p>
After the death of Lieut.-Colonel Farquhar, the
Battalion again retired to rest, and it has not since
returned to the scene of its earliest experience in
trench warfare.  On April 9th it took up a line on
the Polygone Wood, in the Ypres salient, and there
did its round of duty with the customary relief in
billets.  By this time the men were becoming
familiar with their surroundings, and gave play to
their native ingenuity.  Near the trenches they built
log huts from trees in the woods, and it was a
common thing for French, Belgian, and British
officers to visit the camp to admire the work of the
Regiment.  Breastworks were built also behind the
trenches under cover of the woods, and the trenches
themselves were greatly improved.
</p>

<p>
The Battalion presently moved into billets in the
neighbourhood of Ypres, and on April 20th, during
the heavy bombardment of that unhappy town
which preceded the immortal stand of the Canadian
Division, it was ordered to leave billets, and on the
evening of that day moved once again to the
trenches.
</p>

<p>
From April 21st and through the following days
of the second battle of Ypres the Regiment
remained in trenches some distance south and west
of the trenches occupied by the Canadian Division
They were constantly shelled with varying intensity,
and all through those critical days waited, with
ever-growing impatience, for the order that never came
to take part in the battle to the north, where their
kinsmen were undergoing so cruel an ordeal.
</p>

<p>
On May 3rd, after the modification of the line to
the north, the Battalion was withdrawn to a
subsidiary line some distance in the rear.  From eight
in the evening to midnight small parties were silently
withdrawn, until the trenches were held with a
rearguard of fifteen men commanded by Lieut. Lane.
Rapid fire was maintained for more than an hour,
and the rear-guard then withdrew without casualties.
</p>

<p>
On May 4th the Regiment occupied the new line.
On the morning of that day a strong enemy attack
developed.  This was repulsed with considerable
loss to the assailants, and was followed by a heavy
bombardment throughout the day, which demolished
several of the trenches.  At night the Regiment was
relieved by the King's Shropshire Light Infantry
and withdrawn to reserve trenches.  In this
unhealthy neighbourhood no place, by this time, was
safe, and on May 5th, Lieut.-Colonel Buller was
unfortunate enough to lose an eye from the splinter
of a shell which exploded 100 yards away.  Major
Gault arrived during the day and took over
command.  The Battalion was still in high spirits, and
cheered the arrival of an officer to whom all ranks
were attached.
</p>

<p>
Just after dark on the night of May 6th, the
Battalion returned to the trenches and relieved the
2nd King's Shropshire Light Infantry.  Throughout
the night, and all the following day, it was
assailed by a constant and heavy bombardment.
The roll call on the night of the 7th showed the
strength of the Battalion as 635.
</p>

<p>
The day that followed was at once the most
critical and the most costly in the history of the
Battalion.  Early in the morning, particularly heavy
shelling began on the right flank, soon enfilading
the fire trenches.  At 5.30 it grew in intensity, and
gas shells began to fall.  At the same time a number
of Germans were observed coming at the double
from the hill in front of the trench.  This
movement was arrested by a heavy rifle fire.
</p>

<p>
By 6 a.m. every telephone-wire, both to the
Brigade Headquarters and also to the trenches, had
been cut.  All signallers, pioneers, orderlies, and
servants at Battalion Headquarters were ordered into
the support trenches, for the needs of the moment
left no place for supernumeraries.  Every single
Canadian upon the strength was from that time
forward in one or other of the trenches.  A short
and fierce struggle decided the issue for the time
being.  The advance of the Germans was checked,
and those of the enemy who were not either
sheltered by buildings, dead or wounded, crawled
back over the crest of the ridge to their own trenches.
By this time the enemy had two, and perhaps three,
machine-guns in adjacent buildings, and were
sweeping the parapets of both the fire and support
trenches.  An orderly took a note to Brigade
Headquarters informing them exactly of the situation of
the Battalion.
</p>

<p>
About 7 a.m., Major Gault, who had sustained his
men by his coolness and example, was severely hit
by a shell in the left arm and thigh.  It was
impossible to move him, and he lay in the trench, as did
many of his wounded companions, in great anguish
but without a murmur, for over ten hours.
</p>

<p>
The command was taken over by Lieut. Niven,
the next senior officer who was still unwounded.
Heavy Howitzers using high explosives, combined
with field-guns from this moment in a most trying
bombardment both on the fire and support trenches.
The fire trench on the right was blown to pieces at
several points.[<a id="chap08fn2text"></a><a href="#chap08fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p>
At 9 o'clock the shelling decreased in intensity;
but it was the lull before the storm, for the enemy
immediately attempted a second infantry advance.
This attack was received with undiminished resolution.
A storm of machine-gun and rifle fire checked
the assailants, who were forced, after a few
indecisive moments, to retire and take cover.  The
Battalion accounted for large numbers of the enemy
in the course of this attack, but it suffered seriously
itself.  Captain Hill, Lieuts. Martin, Triggs, and
De Bay were all wounded at this time.
</p>

<p>
At half-past nine, Lieut. Niven established
contact with the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry
on the left, and with the 4th Rifle Brigade on the
right.  Both were suffering heavy casualties from
enfilade fire; and neither, of course, could afford
any assistance.  At this time the bombardment
recommenced with great intensity.  The range of
our machine-guns was taken with extreme precision.
All, without exception, were buried.  Those who
served them behaved with the most admirable
coolness and gallantry.  Two were dug out, mounted
and used again.  One was actually disinterred three
times and kept in action till a shell annihilated the
whole section.  Corporal Dover stuck to his gun
throughout and, although wounded, continued to
discharge his duties with as much coolness as if
on parade.  In the explosion that ended his
ill-fated gun, he lost a leg and an arm, and was
completely buried in the <i>débris</i>.  Conscious or
unconscious, he lay there in that condition until dusk,
when he crawled out of all that was left of the
obliterated trench, and moaned for help.  Two of
his comrades sprang from the support trench&mdash;by
this time the fire trench&mdash;and succeeded in carrying
in his mangled and bleeding body.  But as all that
remained of this brave soldier was being lowered
into the trench a bullet put an end to his sufferings.
No bullet could put an end to his glory.
</p>

<p>
At half-past ten the left half of the right fire
trench was completely destroyed; and Lieut.
Denison ordered Lieut. Clarke to withdraw the
remnant of his command into the right communicating
trench.  He himself, with Lieut. Lane, was still
holding all that was tenable of the right fire trench
with a few men still available for that purpose.
Lieut. Edwards had been killed.  The right half
of the left fire trench suffered cruelly.  The trench
was blown in and the machine-gun put out of action.
Sergeant Scott, and the few survivors who still
answered the call, made their way to the communication
trench, and clung tenaciously to it, until that,
too, was blown in.  Lieut. Crawford, whose spirits
never failed him throughout this terrible day, was
severely wounded.  Captain Adamson, who was
handing out small arms ammunition, was hit in the
shoulder, but continued to work with a single arm.
Sergeant-Major Fraser, who was similarly engaged
feeding the support trenches with ammunition, was
killed instantly by a bullet in the head.  At this
time only four officers were left, Lieuts. Papineau,
Vandenberg, Niven, and Clark, of whom the last
two began the war in the ranks.
</p>

<p>
By 12 a.m. the supply of small arms ammunition
badly needed replenishment.  In this necessity the
snipers of the Battalion were most assiduous in the
dangerous task of carrying requests to the Brigade
Headquarters and to the Reserve Battalion, which
was in the rear at Belle-Waarde Lake.  The work
was most dangerous, for the ground which had to
be covered was continually and most heavily shelled.
From 12 a.m. to 1.30 p.m.  the Battalion held on
under the most desperate difficulties until a
detachment of the 4th Rifle Brigade was sent up in
reinforcement The battered defenders of the
support trench recognised old friends coming to
their aid in their moment of extreme trial, and gave
them a loud cheer as they advanced in support.
Lieut. Niven placed them on the extreme right, in
order to protect the Battalion's flanks.  They remained
in line with the Canadian support trenches,
protected by trees and hedges.  They also sent a
machine-gun and section, which rendered invaluable
service.
</p>

<p>
At 2 p.m. Lieut. Niven went with an orderly to
the Headquarters, in obedience to Brigade orders,
to telephone to the General Officer Commanding the
Brigade, complete details of the situation.  He
returned at 2.30 p.m.  The orderlies who
accompanied him both coming and going were hit by
high explosive shells.
</p>

<p>
At 3 p.m. a detachment of the 2nd King's
Shropshire Light Infantry, who were also old comrades in
arms of the Princess Patricias, reached the support
line with twenty boxes of small arms ammunition.
These were distributed, and the party bringing them
came into line as a reinforcement, occupying the left
end of the support trench.  At four o'clock the
support trenches were inspected, and it was found
that contact was no longer maintained with the
regiment on the left, the gap extending for fifty
yards.  A few men (as many as could be spared)
were placed in the gap to do the best they could.
Shortly afterwards news was brought that the
battalions on the left had been compelled to withdraw,
after a stubborn resistance, to a line of trenches a
short distance in the rear.
</p>

<p>
At this moment the Germans made their third and
last attack.  It was arrested by rifle fire, although
some individuals penetrated into the fire trench on
the right.  At this point all the Princess Patricias had
been killed, so that this part of the trench was
actually tenantless.  Those who established a
footing were few in number, and they were gradually
dislodged; and so the third and last attack was
routed as successfully as those which had preceded it.
</p>

<p>
The afternoon dragged on, the tale of casualties
constantly growing; and at ten o'clock at night, the
company commanders being all dead or wounded,
Lieuts. Niven and Papineau took a roll call.  It
disclosed a strength of 150 rifles and some
stretcher-bearers.
</p>

<p>
At 11.30 at night the Battalion was relieved by
the 3rd King's Royal Rifle Corps.  The relieving
unit helped those whom they replaced, in the last
sorrowful duty of burying those of their dead who
lay in the support and communicating trenches.
Those who had fallen in the fire trenches needed
no grave, for the obliteration of their shelter had
afforded a decent burial to their bodies.  Behind the
damaged trenches, by the light of the German flares
and amid the unceasing rattle of musketry, relievers
and relieved combined in the last service which one
soldier can render another.  Beside the open graves,
with heads uncovered, all that was left of the
Regiment stood, while Lieut. Niven, holding the Colours
of Princess Patricia, battered, bloody, but still
intact, tightly in his hand, recalled all he could
remember of the Church of England service for the
dead.  Long after the service was over the remnant
of the Battalion stood in solemn reverie, unable it
seemed to leave their comrades, until the Colonel
of the 3rd King's Royal Rifle Corps gave them
positive orders to retire, when, led by Lieut. Papineau,
they marched back, 150 strong, to reserve
trenches.  On arrival they were instructed to
proceed to another part of the position, where during
the day they were shelled, and lost five killed and
three wounded.
</p>

<p>
In the evening of the 10th the Battalion furnished
a carrying party of fifty men and one officer for
small arms ammunition, and delivered twenty-five
boxes at Belle-Waarde Lake.  One man was killed
and two wounded.  It furnished also a digging party
of 100 men, under Lieut. Clarke, who constructed
part of an additional support trench.
</p>

<p>
On May 13th the Regiment was in bivouac at the
rear.  The news arrived that the 4th Rifle Brigade,
their old and trusty comrades in arms, was being
desperately pressed.  Asked to go to the relief, the
Princess Patricias formed a composite Battalion
with the 4th King's Royal Rifle Corps, and successfully
made the last exertion which was asked of them
at this period of the war.
</p>

<p>
On May 15th Major Pelly arrived from England,
where he had been invalided on March 15th, and
took over the command from Lieut. Niven, who,
during his period of command, had shown qualities
worthy of a regimental commander of any experience
in any army in the world.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of June the Princess Patricias
took up a trench line at Armentières and remained
there until the end of August.  In the middle of
July Lieut. C. J. T. Stewart, a brave officer who
had been severely wounded in the early days of the
Spring, rejoined the Battalion.  Other officers
returning after wounds, and reinforcements from
Canada, brought the Battalion up to full strength
again.
</p>

<p>
Trench work and digging then alternated with
rest.  About the middle of September the Battalion
moved with the 27th Division to occupy a line of
trenches held by the 3rd Army in the south.
</p>

<p>
When the 27th Division was withdrawn from this
line the Princess Patricias were moved into billets
far back from the battle zone, and for a while the
Battalion was detailed to instruct troops arriving
for the 3rd Army.
</p>

<p>
On November 27th, 1915, they were once again
happily reunited with the Canadian Corps after a
long separation.
</p>

<p>
Such, told purposely in the baldest language, and
without attempting any artifice in rhetoric, is the
history of Princess Patricia's Light Infantry
Regiment from the time it reached Flanders till the
present day.
</p>

<p>
Few, indeed, are left of the men who met in
Lansdowne Park to receive the regimental Colours
nearly a year ago; but those who survive, and the
friends of those who have died, may draw solace
from the thought that never in the history of arms
have Soldiers more valiantly sustained the gift and
trust of a Lady.

[<a href="#chap08fn1text">1</a>] Commenting on the Princess Patricias at St. Eloi, in Nelson's
"History of the War," Mr. John Buchan says:&mdash;"Princess

were a pride to the whole Empire&mdash;a pride to be infinitely
heightened by the glorious record of the Canadian Division in the

<p class="sintro">
"I think I can trace the calamities of this country to the single
source of our not having had steadily before our eyes a general,
comprehensive, well-connected, and well-proportioned view of the
whole of our dominions, and a just sense of their true bearings
and relations."&mdash;BURKE.
</p>

<p class="spoem">
  "And statesmen at her council met<br />
  Who knew the seasons when to take<br />
  Occasion by the hand, and make<br />
  The bounds of freedom wider yet."<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;TENNYSON.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The news that the Prime Minister had arranged a
visit to England and to the battlefield in France
aroused great and general interest.  Since the
commencement of the titanic struggle which is now
convulsing the world, the standards by which we
used to measure statesmen have undergone great
modification.  The gifts of brilliant platform
rhetoric, the arts of partisan debate, the instinct for
a conquering election issue, all these have dwindled
before the cruel perspective of war into their true
insignificance.  It is felt here in England to-day,
and not least by some of us who are ourselves
chargeable in the matter, that it will be long before
the politicians at home clear themselves at the
inquest of the nation from the charge of having
endangered the safety of the Empire by their
absorption in those domestic dissensions which now
seem at once so remote and so paltry.
</p>

<p>
And there is already at work a tendency to adopt
wholly different standards in measuring men who,
in the wasted years which lie behind us, kept
steadfast and undeluded eyes upon the Imperial position;
who thought of it and dreamed of it, and worked for
it, when so many others were preaching disarmament
in an armed world, sustaining meanwhile the
combative instinct by the fury with which they flung
themselves into insane domestic quarrels.
</p>

<p>
Sir Robert Borden's was not, perhaps, a personality
which was likely to make a swift or facile
appeal to that collective Imperial opinion whose
conclusions matter so much more than the
conclusions of any individual part of the Empire.
Modest, unassuming, superior to the arts of
advertisement, he never courted a large stage on which
to exhibit the services which he well knew he could
render to the Empire.  To-day it is none the less
recognised that Borden has won his place by the
side of Rhodes and Chamberlain and Botha, in
that charmed circle of clear-sighted statesmen whose
exertions, we may hope, have saved the Empire in
our generation as surely as Chatham and Pitt and
Clive and Hastings saved it in the crisis of an earlier
convulsion.
</p>

<p>
Sir Robert Borden is the first Colonial statesman
who has attended a British Cabinet, a precedent
which may be fruitful in immense Constitutional
developments hereafter.
</p>

<p>
I wonder whether any of those whose deliberations
he assisted recalled the prescience, and the
grave and even noble eloquence, with which Sir
Robert closed his great speech&mdash;delivered how
short a time ago!&mdash;upon the proposed Canadian
contribution to the British Fleet.  The passage is worth
recalling:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="quote">
"The next ten or twenty years will be pregnant
with great results for this Empire, and it
is of infinite importance that questions of
purely domestic concern, however urgent, shall
not prevent any of us from rising to the height
of this great argument.  But to-day, while the
clouds are heavy, and we hear the booming of
the distant thunder, and see the lightning flash
above the horizon, we cannot, and we will not,
wait and deliberate until any impending storm
shall have burst upon us in fury and with
disaster.  Almost unaided, the Motherland, not
for herself alone, but for us as well, is
sustaining the burden of a vital Imperial duty, and
confronting an overmastering necessity of
national existence.  Bringing the best assistance
that we may in the urgency of the moment,
we come thus to her aid in token of our
determination to protect and ensure the safety and
integrity of this Empire, and of our resolve to
defend on sea as well as on land our flag, our
honour, and our heritage."
</p>

<p>
This gift of wise and spacious speech has been
used more than once with extreme impressiveness&mdash;notably
at the Guildhall&mdash;during the Prime Minister's
recent visit.  "All that," he said, "for which
our fathers fought and bled, all our liberties and
institutions, all the influences for good which
penetrate humanity, are in the balance to-day.
Therefore we cannot, because we must not, fail in this
war."
</p>

<p>
It was my duty to accompany Sir Robert Borden
on the visit which he paid to the front, and I gladly
embrace this opportunity of substituting for the
stories of bloodshed and glory, which have engaged
my pen so much, the record of a mission which,
though peaceful, was of profound and often of most
moving interest.
</p>

<p>
Sir Robert Borden arrived in England in the
middle of July.  On Friday, the 16th, he motored
to Shorncliffe, accompanied by Sir George Parley
and Mr. R. B. Bennett, M.P.  There he met General
Hughes.  At nine o'clock on the morning of the
17th the Canadian troops of the 2nd Division
marched past the Prime Minister.  It was impossible
to watch without emotion, if one came from Canada,
this superb body of men gathered from every part of
the Dominion, and animated in all ranks by the
desire to take their place side by side with the
1st Division, and, if possible, to wrest from the war
laurels as glorious as theirs.  Certainly, on the view,
no finer body of men could be imagined, and if to
a critical eye it seemed that the tactical efficiency of
the Western regiments was a shade higher than that
of the Eastern, the reflection readily occurred that
the whole of the 1st Division was criticised, on this
very ground, and that this war, of all wars, is not
to be determined on the parade ground.
</p>

<p>
Sir Robert Borden's tour began on Tuesday,
July 20th.  Accompanied by Mr. R. B. Bennett and
a military staff, he embarked for France.  Colonel
Wilberforce, the Camp Commandant, who had
served on the staff of a former Governor-General
of Canada, met him at the pier on his arrival.  After
lunch he visited a Canadian base hospital,
commanded by Colonel McKee, of Montreal.  It was
pathetic to see the pleasure of the wounded at his
presence, and the plainness with which they showed
it, in spite of the pain which many of them were
suffering.
</p>

<p>
The next visit was paid to a British hospital,
where Sir Robert saw Captain George Bennett, of
the Princess Patricias, who was just fighting his
way back to consciousness after one hundred and
twenty-five days of burning fever.[<a id="chap09fn1text"></a><a href="#chap09fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
From the hospital the Prime Minister went to
the graveyard, where he planted seeds of the maple
tree on the graves of our dead officers and men.
The scene was touching, and Sir Robert was deeply
moved.  Side by side with the British dead, lie
Captain Muntz, of the 3rd Battalion Toronto Regiment,
Major Ward, of the Princess Patricias, whose fruit
farm in the Okanagan Valley lies fallow, and
Lieutenant Campbell, of the 1st Battalion Ontario
Regiment, who won the Victoria Cross and yet did not
live to know it.  How he won it, against what odds,
and facing how certain a death, has been fully told
in another chapter.
</p>

<p>
Sir Robert then visited the McGill College
Hospital, commanded by Colonel Birkett, the Canadian
Base Hospital, in charge of Colonel Shillington,
and Colonel Murray MacLaren's Hospital, under
canvas, in the sand dunes fringing the sea.  Everywhere
one noticed the same patience under suffering,
the same gratitude for all done to relieve pain, and
the same sincere and simple pleasure that the Prime
Minister of Canada had wished to see them and to
thank them.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the long corridor tents in the sand dunes
impressed themselves most upon the memory.  The
convalescents stood to attention to receive the
Colonial Prime Minister.  Some would not be
denied whom the medical staff would perhaps rather
have seen sitting.  Nor was it less moving to notice
how illustrious in private life were many members
of the brilliant staff which had assembled to meet
the first citizen of Canada.  Colonel Murray
MacLaren, Colonel Finlay, Colonel Cameron, and many
others, if they ever reflect upon the immense private
sacrifices they have made, would draw rich
compensation from the knowledge that their skill and
science have in countless cases brought comfort in
the midst of suffering to the heroic soldiers of
Canada.  Sir Robert, in a few sentences of farewell,
made himself the mouthpiece of Canada in rendering
to them a high tribute of respect and gratitude.
</p>

<p>
Early on Wednesday morning the Prime Minister
set forth to visit the Canadian troops at the front.
He was joined in the course of his journey by Prince
Arthur of Connaught, who came to represent the
Governor-General of Canada.
</p>

<p>
The road followed took the party near to where
Canada, at the second battle of Ypres, held the left
of the British line.  The Prime Minister examined
the position with the greatest care and interest, and
looked upon the ruined city of Ypres, and far in
the horizon identified the shattered remnants of
Messines.  And before he left he spoke to those
about him, with deep pride and thankfulness,
of those who stood and died for the honour of
Canada in that great critical day in the Western
Campaign.
</p>

<p>
At noon Sir Robert reached the Canadian
Divisional Headquarters, where he was received by
General Alderson.  Two familiar faces were missing
from the number of those who had made the staff
dispositions in the great battle.  Colonel Romer,
then Chief General Staff Officer, always cool, always
lucid, always resourceful, had become a Brigadier.
He is an extremely able officer, and if a layman may
hazard a prediction as to a soldier's future, he has
in front of him a very brilliant and perhaps a very
high career.  However brilliant and however long
it may prove, he will never, I think, forget the
second battle of Ypres, or the brave comrades
whose exertions it was his duty, under the General,
to co-ordinate and direct.
</p>

<p>
And we missed, too, the quiet but friendly
personality of Colonel Wood (now Brigadier-General),
who had been transferred to Shorncliffe to organise
the Corps Staff.  He has returned again to the
front, and is now in charge of our "Administration."  General
Wood spent some years at the Royal Military
College at Kingston, Ontario, and there acquired
a great knowledge of, and sympathy with, the
Canadian point of view.  He is devoted to the Canadian
troops, of whom he is intensely proud, and they
on their part understand and trust him.
</p>

<p>
General Alderson accompanied Sir Robert on his
visit to the units of the Division not on duty in the
trenches.  The Brigade of General Turner was
commanded for the last time by that officer, for his
soldierly merits have won for him the command of
the 2nd Canadian Division.  The command of his
Brigade has been given to Brigadier-General Leckie,
of whom I have frequently written.
</p>

<p>
Sir Robert addressed the men in a few ringing
sentences which excited the greatest enthusiasm in
all ranks.  The men ran after the moving motor,
and the last to desist was Captain Ralph Markham,
a gallant officer, who was unhappily killed a few
days after by a chance shell as he was returning to
billets along a communication trench.
</p>

<p>
The 2nd Brigade, under the command of General
Currie, who has since been given the command of
the 1st Division, and the 1st Brigade (General
Mercer) were also visited.  Here it was that Colonel
Watson, of Quebec, marched past at the head of the
2nd Battalion, leading his men to the trenches.  A
capable, brave, and very modest officer, he now
commands a Brigade in the 2nd Canadian Division.
</p>

<p>
Sir Robert then visited the trenches accompanied
by General Alderson and Brigadier-General Burstall,
and after a visit to the Army Service Corps,
under Colonel Simpson, he parted from General
Alderson and his fine command.[<a id="chap09fn2text"></a><a href="#chap09fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p>
His next visit was neither less important nor less
interesting, for it was to the Princess Patricia's
Canadian Light Infantry.  The Regiment, which
assembled 500 strong in a field five miles from
Canadian Headquarters, received with cheers,
which broke out again and again, the Prime Minister
and the brother of the Princess, under whose name
and favour the Battalion has so bravely fought.
Major Pelly was in command, the second-in-command
being Lieutenant (now Captain) Niven, of
whose deeds I attempted to give some account in
the preceding chapter.
</p>

<p>
The Regiment was formed in three sides of a
square and as the Prime Minister and the Prince
advanced, the colours, presented by the Princess in
Lansdowne Park on that great day which seems so
long ago, were ceremoniously unfurled.  And, as the
tattered folds spread before a light breeze, the clouds
broke, and there was a moment or two of bright
sunshine.  Overhead two enemy aeroplanes flew, and
there followed them persistently through the sky
bursting shells of shrapnel.
</p>

<p>
The Prime Minister conveyed in simple words
a message from the Governor-General.  The Prince,
in plain and soldierly language, spoke in deep
affection of the Regiment whose glory, he said, was so
dear to his sister's heart.  The men were deeply
moved.
</p>

<p>
On his return to Headquarters the Prime Minister
was invited to take part in a conference with the
Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief and his Staff.
Among those present was his Royal Highness the
Prince of Wales.
</p>

<p>
It had been arranged that Sir Robert's visit to
the French armies&mdash;a visit most courteously and
even pressingly suggested by the French
Government&mdash;should take place on the conclusion of the
conference at General Headquarters.
</p>

<p>
Sir Robert was received at a small town, which
it would be indiscreet to name, by General Joffre.
The famous General, who was full of confidence and
hope, was surrounded by one of the most brilliant
staffs which any army in the world could boast.  For
a long time he discussed with the most charming
frankness, and the most lucid explanations, the
position and the prospects of the Allied forces in the
field.
</p>

<p>
The French Staff was most anxious to enlarge
upon their plans in conversation with the Prime
Minister.  It was interesting, indeed, to an observer
of Canadian birth, to listen to the animated
conversation carried on entirely in French.  What
reflections did the interview not suggest?  The
Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Army of France
in conference with the Prime Minister of Canada
in the throes of a mighty war!  Jacques Cartier,
Frontenac, De Levis, De Salaberry, Wolfe,
Montcalm, the Heights of Abraham, the far-flung
antagonism of the great French and British
nations&mdash;how many memories crowded the mind as one
silently watched this historic interview!  And, of all
reflections, perhaps the most insistent was that the
bitterest antagonisms of mankind may be composed
in a period relatively very brief.
</p>

<p>
After a long day in the French trenches, varied
by visits to advanced observation posts, from which
the Prime Minister could plainly see the German
front-line trenches, the party returned through the
stricken city of Albert.  The majestic fabric of its
ancient cathedral has been smitten with a heavy
hand.  There remain only a scarred and desolate
ruin, and the figure of the Madonna&mdash;a true Mater
Dolorosa&mdash;hung suspended in mid-air from the
mutilated spire.
</p>

<p>
And so to Paris, with minds saddened indeed by
all the misery and the havoc and the horror, but still
full of confidence that right shall yet conquer wrong,
that a period shall yet be assigned to that bloody
and calculated savagery which has swept ever so
many fair provinces in Europe, and has not yet
abandoned the hope of dominating the world.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the week was spent with the Government
in Paris and in discussion with the French
President and the Minister of War.  Here again
Sir Robert met with the most distinguished
kindness.  Nothing promising or unpromising in the
prospects of the Allies was concealed from him,
and on his departure from Paris the First Citizen
of France conferred upon the First Citizen of
Canada the highest order of the Legion of Honour.
</p>

<p>
After a visit on the way home to the great
Canadian Base Hospital, over which Colonel Bridges,
an officer of the Permanent Force, presides, and in
which Major Keenan, of Montreal and of the
Princess Patricias, gives his services, the party
reached Boulogne on Sunday, and were carried back
to English soil again.
</p>

<p>
Monday morning was spent in visiting the great
hospital at Shorncliffe, which is under the direction
of Colonel Scott, of Toronto.  Everywhere one
noticed in the hospitals the same cheerfulness, the
same patience under suffering, and the same
unaffected pleasure at the visit of the Prime Minister.
</p>

<p>
In the late afternoon the Prime Minister arrived
at the Canadian Convalescent Home, where troops
are gathered from all the hospitals in England,
either to return in due course to duty or leave for
ever the military service.  This wonderful
organisation is under the direction of Captain McCombe.
The institution&mdash;so largely his creation&mdash;is a shining
example of what such a home can become under
intelligent and humane direction.
</p>

<p>
The convalescents here were over a thousand
strong.  Those physically fit stood to attention.
Others in the blue and white uniform of the
hospital leaned heavily upon their crutches.  Others
lay upon their couches unable to move, but watching
and listening intently.  All Canada was represented,
from Halifax to Vancouver.  Here were the survivors
of the battle for the Wood; there a remnant of the
heroes who charged to save the British left.  Here
were those brave men who gloriously assaulted the
Orchard; there the veterans of the 1st Ontario
Regiment who attacked on June 15th.
</p>

<p>
The Prime Minister was profoundly moved.
Flanders had moved him too.  Nor had he escaped
deep feeling when he saw the Canadian troops
marching to the trenches.  But not until he came
face to face with the shattered survivors of four
glorious battles, did he openly show that deep spring
of emotion and affection which those who saw him
will always cherish as their fondest recollection of him.
</p>

<p>
The warmth and sincerity of his nature found
expression in one of the most wonderful speeches
which he or anyone else has ever made.  It has not
been reported; it cannot be reported, for those who
heard him were themselves too much moved to
recollect the words.  But it was a speech vital with
humanity; it was the speech of a father who mourned
over stricken sons, and, closing in a sterner note, it
was the speech of one who foresaw and promised a
day of retribution for the conscienceless race which,
with cold calculation, had planned this outrage on
humanity.
</p>

<p>
And so ended the memorable journey.  The
narrative attempted here cannot, of course, be too
explicit.  But the writer has not altogether failed in
his purpose if he has shown the dignity, the restraint,
the eloquence, and the wisdom with which the Prime
Minister of Canada has represented our great
Dominion among the leading soldiers and
statesmen of Europe.

[<a href="#chap09fn1text">1</a>] Since that time Captain Bennett has been brought to England,
but even now he is in a convalescent home and only slowly
recovering.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap09fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap09fn2text">2</a>] Before returning to England, Sir Robert Borden sent the
following message to General Alderson, which was circulated
in Orders of July 30th:&mdash;"The fine spirit of the Canadian
Division, and their evident efficiency for the great task in which
they are engaged, very deeply impressed me.  It was a great
privilege to have the opportunity of seeing them, and of conveying
to them, from the people of Canada, a message of pride and
appreciation.  As I said on more than one occasion in addressing
the officers and men, they can hardly realise how intensely all
Canada has been thrilled by the tidings of their achievements.
The President of the French Republic, as well as General Joffre
and Sir John French, spoke of the troops under your command
in terms of the highest praise.  I bid you God speed in the
great task in which you are engaged."

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fortes a fortibus creantur."<br />
  Brave men are created by brave men.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Save for the great interest aroused by the visit
of the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Borden, an
almost uncanny tranquillity reigned along the whole
Canadian front during the month of July.
</p>

<p>
The enemy soon became aware that new troops
had taken up the position, and reconnaissance
parties were very active in endeavouring to ascertain
precisely what troops they now had opposite them.
They had probably caught a few words from our
trenches which were sufficient to tell them that they
were now opposed to Canadians, and they were no
doubt anxious to discover whether they were
confronted by the experienced veterans who had proved
their qualities at Ypres, or whether their opponents
were the soldiers of the 2nd Division, as yet fresh
to the field of war.
</p>

<p>
We, for our part, had a similar curiosity.  We,
too, were anxious to discover the identity and,
therefore, the quality, of the men whose trenches it was
our lot to watch by night and by day.
</p>

<p>
Knowing, however, that their reconnaissance
parties were moving about, we were content to bide our
time&mdash;to await the opportunity of seizing upon one
of their detachments when they were either careless,
ill-led, or over-bold.
</p>

<p>
That opportunity came at "Plug Street" at half-past
eight on the morning of July 27th.  One of the
observers of the 3rd Battalion (Toronto Regiment)
reported a party of the enemy in the wild wheat,
never to be garnered, growing between the British
and German lines.  It was then that Captain Tidy,
with Private Bruno, who had joined the Battalion
at Valcartier from the Queen's Own of Toronto, and
two other privates of the names of Candlish and
Subervitch, left the trenches and crawled out to
take the enemy by surprise.  In this they were
successful.  Two of the Germans surrendered the
moment they were covered by Captain Tidy's pistol;
but the third, though putting up his hands at
first, lowered them again and fired at the officer.
At this, Bruno, who was in a crouching position
among the wheat, fired two shots from the hip and
killed the treacherous German.  The party returned
safely with their two prisoners, though the whole
affair had taken place in full view of the German
trenches.  The prisoners, when questioned, stated
that they had been sent out during the night in the
hope that they would be able to identify our troops.
</p>

<p>
July was a sniper's month.  True, every month
is a sniper's month; the great game of sniping never
wanes, but the inactivity in other methods of fighting
left the field entirely free for the sharpshooter in
July.
</p>

<p>
It was during the fighting at Givenchy in June,
1915, that four snipers of the 8th Canadian
Battalion (Winnipeg Rifles) agreed to record their
professional achievements from that time forward on
the wood of their rifles.
</p>

<p>
Private Ballendine, one of the four, is from
Battleford.  He is tall and loosely built.  In his
swarthy cheeks, black eyes, and straight black hair,
he shows his right to claim Canadian citizenship
by many generations of black-haired, sniping
ancestors.  He learned to handle a rifle with some
degree of skill at the age of ten years, and he has
been shooting ever since.  At the present time he
carries thirty-six notches on the butt of his rifle.
Each notch stands for a dead German&mdash;to the best
of Ballendine's belief.  One notch, cut longer and
deeper into the brown wood than me others, means
an officer.
</p>

<p>
To date, Private Smith, of Roblin, Manitoba, has
scratched the wood of his rifle only fourteen times;
but he is a good shot, has faith in his weapon, and
looks hopefully to the future.
</p>

<p>
Private McDonald, of Port Arthur, displays no
unseemly elation over his score of twenty-six.
</p>

<p>
Private Patrick Riel makes a strong appeal to the
imagination, though his tally is less than McDonald's
by two or three.  He is a descendant of the late
Louis Riel, and when he enlisted in the 90th
Winnipeg Rifles at the outbreak of the war, and was
told by one of his officers that his regiment had done
battle against his cousin Louis at Fish Creek and
Batoche, he showed only a mild interest in this trick
of Time.  Riel, like McDonald, comes from Port
Arthur way.  Before the war he earned his daily
bacon and tobacco as a foreman of lumber-jacks on
the Kaministiquia River.
</p>

<p>
The weapons used by these four snipers are Ross
rifles, remodelled to suit their peculiar and
particular needs.  Each is mounted with a telescopic
sight, and from beneath the barrel of each much of
the wood of the casing has been cut away.  The men
do their work by day, as the telescopic sight is not
good for shooting in a poor light.  They are
excused all fatigues while in the trenches and go
about their grim tasks without hint or hindrance
from their superiors.  They choose their own
positions from which to observe the enemy and to fire
upon him&mdash;sometimes in leafy covers behind our
front-line trench, sometimes behind our parapet.
Very little of their work is done in the "No Man's
Land" between the hostile lines, for there danger
from the enemy is augmented by the chance of a shot
from some zealous but mistaken comrade.  The
mention of "No Man's Land" reminds me that, on the
Canadian front, this desolate and perilous strip of
land is now called "Canada."  The idea is that our
patrols have the upper hand here, night and
day&mdash;that we govern the region, though we have not
stationed any Governor or Resident Magistrate there
as yet.
</p>

<p>
Our bombers, too, are an interesting and peculiar
body of men, evolved by the needs of this warfare
from all classes.  Sergeant William Tabernacle is
a bomber.  He has lived for so long in an
environment of cramped quarters, alternating five
days and five nights of narrow trenches and
low dug-outs, with five days and five nights of
circumscribed huts in the reserve lines, week after
week, month after month, that he sometimes wonders
if the pictures in the back of his mind&mdash;pictures of
dry-floored houses, wide beds, and secure streets&mdash;are
memories or only dreams.  At first, for a little
while, he fretted after the soft things of the old, soft
life in far-away Canada; but now he is content to
shape his life and live it only from day to day, to
question the future as little as to review the past.
The things that matter to William now are the
things of the moment&mdash;the trench mortars behind
the opposite parapet, the guns screened in the wood
behind our own lines, food, and his ration of rum.
</p>

<p>
William loves bombs, though he had never heard
of such things before the war and had never believed
in them until two exploded near him, in the first trench
of his experience&mdash;long ago, before the Second
Battle of Ypres.  It seems that he brought to France
with him, all unknown to himself or his comrades,
an instinctive understanding of and affection for
every variety of explosive missile.  He grasped
the idea and intention of this phase of warfare
in a flash&mdash;in the flash of his first hostile
grenade.  He was told to be a bomber; so he
became a bomber, and everything he threw exploded
with precision.  His Colonel made a Corporal of
him.  As Corporal he added to his duties of
throwing bombs the work of overhauling the bombs of
others and of manufacturing a few on his own
account.  He became a Sergeant&mdash;and now he is an
accepted authority on bombs.  He makes them,
repairs them, assembles them, takes care of them,
issues them to his men, and sometimes heaves a few
himself, just to show the youngsters how the trick
is done.
</p>

<p>
Nothing comes amiss to William.  Bombs and
grenades that enter his trench and fail to explode
are quickly investigated, and, sooner or later, are
returned to their original owners in working order.
Rifle grenades that explode in William's vicinity
never fail to attract his attention, and while others
attend to the wounded he looks for the stick.
Finding the stick, he immediately welds it to the base
of a small, cone-shaped bomb from his own stores&mdash;and,
behold, a rifle grenade of superior quality all
ready to be fired against the enemy's loopholes.
</p>

<p>
William is considered by some to have grown
peculiar in his habits.  His dug-out is hung and
cluttered with the materials and tools and weapons
of his trade.  He fondles specimens of British,
French, and German bombs, even as old ladies back
in Canada fondle their grandchildren.  He expatiates
on their good points and their defects.  He
has his favourites, of course, and should anyone
venture to belittle the fuse, the detonating charge,
or the explosive quality of one of his favourites, he
becomes arrogant, ill-mannered, and quarrelsome.
</p>

<p>
William lives to-day for the explosion of
to-morrow.  If he were Lord Kitchener doubtless this
war would end very suddenly, some fine day, in a
rending crash that would split and rip these fair
lands from the sea to the high hills.
</p>

<p>
William is a Canadian.  Before the war his
fellow-countrymen believed that he lacked ambition and
smoked too many cigarettes.  But here he is doing
his queer work, in his own queer way, in a trench in
the Low Countries&mdash;one of the hardest rivets
to break or bend in that long barrier which the
fighting legions of Germany can neither bend nor
break.
</p>

<p>
One cannot help wondering what William will
do for excitement when he returns to that little town
in Ontario&mdash;if ever he does return.  Perhaps, an
Uncle Toby of the New World, he will tell, "with
remembrances," the story of how he "fought in
Flanders" on the old soil and with the old weapons.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>


<p>
At the beginning of August the men were cheered
by a welcome visitor from home&mdash;Major-General
Sir Sam Hughes, K.C.B., whom the men naturally
regard as the father of the Canadian Contingent.
</p>

<p>
The passionate love of country, the lofty, if
inarticulate, patriotism which called men from the
lumber camp and the mine, the desk and the store,
was expressed in the formation of great armies, by
the guiding hand of the Minister of Militia.
</p>

<p>
At that supreme moment in our country's history,
when Canada was at the cross roads of her destiny,
she was indeed happy in the possession of the man
who gathered in and marshalled, with a speed and
noble energy seldom, if ever, equalled, the hosts of
willing but untrained civilians who came rushing
from the Pacific Coast, the Rockies, the grain-belt,
the Western Prairie, and the fields and forests and
cities of the East, to offer themselves to the Empire
in her hour of need.
</p>

<p>
It is unnecessary to dwell upon the efforts which
in a few weeks assembled the first armies of Canada,
armies which were in a brief period to prove that
they were able to meet on equal terms the military
brood of the great Frederick.  Indeed, properly to
enforce the true spirit and meaning of Canada's
great arming, one cannot insist too strongly on the
wonderful fact that by a supreme effort of organisation,
men who had, in the main, passed their lives
in peaceful pursuits, were forged into an army fitted
to face with honour and success the highly trained
hordes of a nation steeped for centuries in the
traditions of militarism.
</p>

<p>
These gallant men of ours have displayed a
valour which has never been surpassed; they have
become versed in the arts of war with a thoroughness
and swiftness which gives them a superb
confidence, even when faced by overwhelming numbers
of the Kaiser's hosts.  And they are full of a great
joy and a great pride when they consider that
new-born civilian armies have done so much.
</p>

<p>
Every Canadian soldier, too, is heartened by an
appreciation of the fact that in every detail of arms,
equipment, and supply, the organisation behind him
works ceaselessly to make every Canadian unit as
perfect a fighting machine as can be.  They know
that, thanks to Major-General Carson, the Agent
of the Militia Department in England, all their
requirements for fighting purposes are thought out
in advance, and provided to the last detail in more
than good time.  Such confidence makes for material
well-being, and a spirit of intuitive military flair
does the rest.
</p>

<p>
General Hughes is a business soldier, though he
possesses a true soldier's heart.  A soldier is
popularly supposed to be a silent man.  When the
statesmen and the politicians have ceased talking,
when all their speeches have been of no avail and it
is left to the guns to speak "the last word of Kings,"
the civilian believes that his military leaders are not
in the habit of speechmaking.  That idea, however,
is profoundly mistaken.  A study of military history
shows that all great leaders who have inspired troops
to resist to the death when disaster appeared to be
certain, and all great leaders who have victoriously
led assaults which seemed the very children of
despair, have had the capacity of making what in
armies is known as a "soldier's speech."
</p>

<p>
It is an art which cannot be cultivated.  It is the
instinctive knowledge of precisely the right road to
the soldier's heart at the supreme moment when an
appeal may make all the difference between success
or failure.[<a id="chap10fn1text"></a><a href="#chap10fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
War makes men's minds simple and sentimental.
Without sentiment, armies could never, in free
communities, be got together, and armies could never be
led.  Lord Kitchener proved that he had a very
great understanding of the art of the "soldier's
speech" when he issued his message to the Expeditionary
Force on the eve of its sailing for France.
It made an ineffaceable impression on the men, and
its inspiration saw them through the bitter hours of
the long retreat from Mons.
</p>

<p>
Just before his death Lord Roberts made a speech
to the Indian troops, from which they drew a fervour
which carried them through many a bloody welter,
in which the best soldiers in the world might have
succumbed.
</p>

<p>
The Military Correspondent of <i>The Times</i>, too,
has borne witness to the fact that Sir John French
knows precisely what to say to reach and stir the
soldier's heart.
</p>

<p>
And General Hughes has the same gift.  He
employed it well when he spoke to the troops he had
come to visit.  He did not say much, but his words
had an electrical effect upon the men's patriotism,
and strengthened them to fight even more sternly
than they had already done for freedom; while, in
the contemplation of soldierly glory, he made them
forget the horrors and losses of the preceding months.
</p>

<p>
It was on Thursday, August 5th, that the Minister
for War crossed from Folkestone to Boulogne on a
British destroyer, accompanied by Brigadier-General
Lord Brooke, acting A.D.C. to Lord Kitchener, and
Lieut.-Colonel Carrick, M.P., the Canadian
representative at the General Headquarters of the British
Army in France.  At Boulogne the party was met
by Captain Frederick Guest, M.P., A.D.C. to Sir
John French.
</p>

<p>
Early the following morning Sir Sam Hughes
motored to the British Headquarters, where he was
received by the Commander-in-Chief.  After a
brief meeting, the party motored to Belgian
Headquarters, whence they made a tour of the
Belgian lines and inspected the Belgian trenches.
</p>

<p>
Later, the Minister met King Albert in a little
cottage on the seashore, and there, with the King,
he went thoroughly into the whole Belgian position,
and in particular the Belgian defences, while shells
were whistling unceasingly overhead.  That night he
returned to the British Headquarters, where he met
Prince Alexander of Teck, who, until the outbreak
of the war, was Governor-General Designate of
Canada.
</p>

<p>
The next day, accompanied by Prince Alexander,
the Minister met General Alderson and his Staff
near Armentières.  And it was deeply interesting to
watch the meeting between these two men&mdash;the man
who had called the Canadian Army into being, and
the man who commanded it in the field.
</p>

<p>
It was at this time that discussions took place
and decisions were reached in regard to sending the
2nd Canadian Division to join the Army in France.
</p>

<p>
From that meeting the two Generals went straight
into the firing line, and General Hughes made an
inspection of the men he had come so far to see.
He noted how cheerful, fit, and well the men were,
in spite of the perils and hardships they had undergone.
</p>

<p>
Along the line of trenches the General met many
officers and men he knew.  All of them knew him.
There were delighted greetings, quick handclasps,
and brief exchanges of conversation, from which
radiated pride, heartiness, and good sense.
</p>

<p>
Later, the Minister went up to the main artillery
observation post, and here General Burstall gave a
very effective exhibition of what Canadian guns can
do.  But it was a demonstration which called forth a
reply from the German trenches, and soon enemy
shells were screaming inwards.
</p>

<p>
Next the General inspected Strathcona's Horse,
the Royal Canadian Dragoons, and 2nd King
Edward's Horse, under Brigadier-General the
Right Hon. J. C. Seely, M.P., with whose soldierly
mind and strangely similar personality the Minister
found himself in accord.
</p>

<p>
That evening, on his return to the British
Headquarters, he dined with Sir John French and the
Prince of Wales.
</p>

<p>
On the Sunday morning the General inspected
the Princess Patricias, and later in the day he
spent some time with General Sir Douglas Haig.
Sir Douglas realised at once General Hughes'
gift for the appreciation of military positions,
and went very fully with him into the defences
of the 1st Army.  It must afford Canadians
not only satisfaction, but pride, to know that
their Minister was able to make suggestions of
great value.  Then the General set out for Festubert
and Givenchy.  Afterwards came the inspection of
the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery under Colonel
Panet.
</p>

<p>
On Monday morning the Minister motored to the
Headquarters of General Foch, and the meeting was
a pleasant one because the two men were old friends.
They had been companions on three successive
years at British and French Army manoeuvres, and
they had much to discuss as, during the afternoon,
they traversed the French lines.  Major-General
Hughes spent the evening with the French
Generalissimo, with whose clear, bold thinking
and kindly but robust personality he was much
impressed.
</p>

<p>
On Tuesday he went to Rheims, where he was
met by General D'Espéré, of the French 1st Army,
in whose company he witnessed the terrible traces
of recent heavy fighting&mdash;shattered caissons,
splintered gun carriages, and ruined buildings, and,
above all, that towering monument to German
"frightfulness"&mdash;the shattered mass of the great
cathedral.
</p>

<p>
The next day Major-General Hughes proceeded
to Paris, where he was entertained by Lord Bertie,
the British Ambassador, and met the President of
the Republic and the French Minister of War.
</p>

<p>
He returned to England as he had come, in a
destroyer.
</p>

<p>
Before sailing from Liverpool, the Minister wrote
the following farewell, which was made known to
the troops through Orders of the Day:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="quote">
"In departing for Canada, it is my desire to
thank all the splendid forces&mdash;Canadians of
whom we are so justly proud&mdash;at the front, for
their splendid services to King, country, and
the glorious cause of Liberty.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"When these troops left Valcartier last year
and sailed from Canadian shores, I took the
liberty of predicting that when they met the
foe they would give an account of themselves
that would reflect honour upon the glorious
Empire whose liberties we are all endeavouring
to maintain.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"The highest predictions have been more
than fulfilled.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"I am leaving you all more than ever proud
of our gallant boys.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"They have already earned the recognition
of a grateful country.  Throughout whatever
trials these valiant soldiers may pass, they will
be encouraged and strengthened by the thought
that behind them, in Canada, those near and
dear to them realise that their duty will be done
fearlessly and well.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"May kind heaven guard and prosper these
brave fellows in their great struggle.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"(Sgd.) SAM HUGHES, Major-General,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Minister of Militia and Defence."<br />
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
August passed quietly by.[<a id="chap10fn2text"></a><a href="#chap10fn2">2</a>]  The enemy sometimes
shelled our trenches, but never heavily, and
the Canadians enjoyed a comparatively peaceful
summer month.
</p>

<p>
In the early days of September the Canadian
Government determined, in response to the requirements
and necessities of the Empire, to furnish
another Division, thus placing a complete Army
Corps in the field.
</p>

<p>
It was a matter of intense gratification to the
Canadians that General Alderson, who had so brilliantly
led the 1st Division in the terrible and hard-fought
battles in Flanders, was appointed to command
the Corps.
</p>

<p>
General Alderson is a soldier with great experience
and with great military gifts, and, above all, a
genius for the leadership of men.
</p>

<p>
Apart from his qualities as a soldier, however, a
simple and noble personality illumines his character.
It is not too much to say that every officer and man
under his command loves and trusts him.  Not only,
however, have they confidence in his military leadership,
but they know that in his personality, and in his
whole outlook upon humanity, he is to be respected
and trusted too.
</p>

<p>
With the arrival in France of the 2nd Division,[<a id="chap10fn3text"></a><a href="#chap10fn3">3</a>]
and the formation of the Canadian Army Corps, a
point is reached which clearly marks the end of the
first phase of Canada's part in the world war.
</p>

<p>
Henceforth we shall be represented in the field by
an Army Corps, a noble contribution to the necessity
of the Empire.  When we contemplate, quite apart
from their moral value, the immense material
contributions which the Dominions have made
to this campaign, we may reflect with irony upon
the strange errors of which many brilliant men are
capable.
</p>

<p>
Professor Goldwin Smith wrote of the
Canadians:&mdash;"Judge whether these men are likely to
pour out their blood without stint for the British
connection; see at least first, whether they are ready
to pour out a little money or to reduce their duties
on your goods."  And he joyfully quoted Cobden.
"Loyalty is an ironical term to apply to people who
neither obey our orders nor hold themselves liable
to fight our battles."
</p>

<p>
We may perhaps be permitted to hope that the
study of the past is sometimes more helpful to those
who presume to foretell the future.
</p>

<p>
The 2nd Division cannot fail to be inspired by
the superb example of that with which it is linked.
It has the advantage of being commanded by a most
distinguished and experienced officer, Major-General
Turner, V.C., the Brigadier-General Turner who
held the left at Ypres in the great days of April.
</p>

<p>
Of all the officers of high rank fighting to-day in
Flanders, none is more modest, none more resourceful,
none more chivalrous.  He is in Canada a great
national figure.  Conspicuous among the heroes of
Ypres, he will in his new position write his record
in Flanders, in letters not indeed more glorious, but
upon a larger slate.
</p>

<p>
And here for the present we take leave of the
Canadians in Flanders.  After incredible hardships
patiently supported, after desperate battles stubbornly
contested, their work is still incomplete.  But
they will complete it, meeting new necessities with
fresh exertions, for it is the work of Civilisation and
of Liberty.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap10fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap10fn1text">1</a>] The classic example of this form of eloquence is contained
in Napoleon's address to the Army of Italy, made on April 26th,
1796.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
"Soldiers!  In fifteen days you have won six victories, captured
twenty-one flags, fifty-five guns, several fortresses, conquered the
richest part of Piedmont: you have made 15,000 prisoners: you
have killed or wounded nearly 10,000 men.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
"Until now you have fought for barren rocks.  Lacking everything,
you have accomplished everything.  You have won battles
without cannon, crossed rivers without bridges, made forced
marches without boots, bivouacked without brandy, and often
without bread.  Only the phalanx of the Republic, only the
soldiers of Liberty, could endure the things that you have suffered.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
"There are more battles before you, more cities to capture, more
rivers to cross.  You all burn to carry forward the glory of the
French people; to dictate a glorious peace; and to be able when
you return to your villages to exclaim with pride, 'I belonged
to the conquering army of Italy.'"
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap10fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap10fn2text">2</a>] It was on August 1st that the enemy carried out a severe
bombardment of a location known as "Ration Farm," opposite
Messines, which drove the men of Major Hesketh's squadron of
Strathcona's Horse, who were in reserve, into their dug-outs.
The farm was hit repeatedly, and suddenly sounds as of heavy
machine-gun fire were heard coming from the midst of the
shattered buildings.  Major Hesketh left his dug-out and entered
the farm to investigate.  He saw that the magazine, containing
100,000 rounds of ammunition with the reserve supply of bombs
and grenades, had been pierced and set on fire by a high explosive
shell.  In spite of the fact that the position was still under
persistent shell fire, that the small-arms ammunition was exploding
rapidly under the influence of the heat, and that the entire
contents of the magazine was likely to explode at any moment,
Major Hesketh fought the fire with sacks and extinguished it.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap10fn3"></a>
[<a href="#chap10fn3text">3</a>] Prior to its departure for France the 2nd Division was
commanded by General Sam Steele, C.B., M.V.O., a distinguished
Canadian soldier and a distinguished Canadian citizen.  General
Steele's military experience dates from the days of the Red River
Expedition, and his appointment was much appreciated by the
officers and troops of the 2nd Division during their period of
training.  He has since joined the Imperial Service, and is now
the General Officer Commanding at Shorncliffe.

THE KING'S MESSAGE TO THE CANADIANS.
</h4>

<p class="t3b">
To the First Division.
</p>

<p>
On February 4th, 1915, His Majesty the King
inspected the 1st Canadian Division on Salisbury
Plain, and afterwards wrote a message to the troops,
which was read to all units on board ship after their
embarkation for France.  The full text of the
message is as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="quote">
Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers, and Men:
</p>

<p class="quote">
At the beginning of November I had the
pleasure of welcoming to the Mother Country
this fine contingent from the Dominion of
Canada, and now, after three months' training,
I bid you Godspeed on your way to assist my
Army in the field.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I am well aware of the discomforts that you
have experienced from the inclement weather
and abnormal rain, and I admire the cheerful
spirit displayed by all ranks in facing and
overcoming all difficulties.
</p>

<p class="quote">
From all I have heard, and from what I have
been able to see at to-day's inspection and
march-past, I am satisfied that you have made
good use of the time spent on Salisbury Plain.
</p>

<p class="quote">
By your willing and prompt rally to our
common flag you have already earned the
gratitude of the Motherland.
</p>

<p class="quote">
By your deeds and achievements on the field
of battle I am confident that you will emulate
the example of your fellow-countrymen in the
South African War, and thus help to secure the
triumph of our arms.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I shall follow with pride and interest all your
movements.  I pray that God may bless you
and watch over you.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
To the Second Division.
</p>

<p>
On September 2nd, 1915, the King, accompanied
by Lord Kitchener, inspected the 2nd Division in
Beachborough Park, Shorncliffe.  Before leaving,
His Majesty directed General Turner to inform all
Commanding Officers that he considered the
Division one of the finest he had inspected since the
beginning of the war.  Subsequently the following
message from the King was published in Orders:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="quote">
Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers, and
Men of the 2nd Canadian Division&mdash;six months
ago I inspected the 1st Canadian Division
before their departure for the front.  The
heroism they have since shown upon the field
of battle has won for them undying fame.  You
are now leaving to join them, and I am glad to
have an opportunity of seeing you to-day, for it
has convinced me that the same spirit that
animated them inspires you also.  The past
weeks at Shorncliffe have been for you a period
of severe and rigorous training; and your
appearance at this inspection testifies to the
thoroughness and devotion to duty with which
your work has been performed.  You are going
to meet hardships and dangers, but the
steadiness and discipline which have marked your
bearing on parade to-day will carry you through
all difficulties.  History will never forget the
loyalty and readiness with which you rallied
to the aid of your Mother Country in the hour
of danger.  My thoughts will always be with
you.  May God bless you and bring you victory.

With regard to these inspections, I may mention
in particular the fine appearance presented by the
27th and 28th Divisions, composed principally of
battalions which had come from India.
</p>

<p>
Included in the former Division was the Princess
Patricia's Royal Canadian Regiment.  They are a
magnificent set of men, and have since done
excellent work in the trenches.

PRINCESS PATRICIAS' ATTACK AT<br />
ST. ELOI, FEBRUARY 28th, 1915.<br />
</p>

<p>
On February 28th a successful minor attack was
made on the enemy's trenches near St. Eloi by small
parties of the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light
Infantry.  The attack was divided into three small
groups, the whole under the command of Lieutenant
Crabbe: No. 1 group under Lieutenant Papineau,
No. 2 group under Sergeant Patterson, and No. 3
group under Company Sergeant-Major Lloyd.
</p>

<p>
The head of the party got within fifteen or twenty
yards of the German trench and charged; it was
dark at the time (about 5.15 a.m.).
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Crabbe, who showed the greatest dash
and <i>élan</i>, took his party over everything in the trench
until they had gone down it about eighty yards,
when they were stopped by a barricade of sandbags
and timber.  This party, as well as the others, then
pulled down the front face of the German parapet.
A number of Germans were killed and wounded,
and a few prisoners were taken.
</p>

<p>
The services performed by this distinguished
corps have continued to be very valuable since I
had occasion to refer to them in my last despatch.
They have been most ably organised, trained, and
commanded by Lieut.-Colonel F. D. Farquhar,
D.S.O., who, I deeply regret to say, was killed while
superintending some trench work on March 20th.
His loss will be deeply felt.

MARCH 14th, 1915.
</p>

<p>
It is satisfactory to be able to record that, though
the troops occupying the first line of trenches were
at first overwhelmed, they afterwards behaved very
gallantly in the counter-attack for the recovery of
the lost ground, and the following units earned and
received the special commendation of the Army
Commander.  The 2nd Royal Irish Fusiliers, the
2nd Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, the 1st
Leinster Regiment, the 4th Rifle Brigade, and the
Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry.

ARRIVAL OF CANADIAN DIVISION&mdash;<br />
NEUVE CHAPELLE.
</p>

<p>
On February 15th the Canadian Division began
to arrive in this country.  I inspected the Division,
which was under the command of Lieut.-General
E. A. H. Alderson, C.B., on February 20th.
</p>

<p>
They presented a splendid and most soldier-like
appearance on parade.  The men were of good
physique, hard, and fit.  I judged by what I saw
of them that they were well trained, and quite able
to take their places in the line of battle.
</p>

<p>
Since then the Division has thoroughly justified
the good opinion I formed of it.
</p>

<p>
The troops of the Canadian Division were first
attached for a few days by brigades for training
in the 3rd Corps trenches under Lieut.-General Sir
William Pulteney, who gave me such an excellent
report of their efficiency that I was able to employ
them in the trenches early in March.
</p>

<p>
During the battle of Neuve Chapelle they held a
part of the line allotted to the 1st Army, and
although they were not actually engaged in the main
attack, they rendered valuable help by keeping the
enemy actively employed in front of their trenches.
</p>

<p>
All the soldiers of Canada serving in the army
under my command have so far splendidly upheld
the traditions of the Empire, and will, I feel sure,
prove to be a great source of additional strength to
the forces in this country.

<p class="t3b">
SECOND BATTLE OF YPRES.
</p>

<p>
It was at the commencement of the second battle
of Ypres, on the evening of April 22nd, referred to
in Paragraph 1 of this report, that the enemy first
made use of asphyxiating gas.
</p>

<p>
Some days previously I had complied with
General Joffre's request to take over the trenches
occupied by the French, and on the evening of the
22nd the troops holding the line east of Ypres were
posted as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
From Steenstraate to the east of Langemarck, as
far as the Poelcappelle road, a French division.
</p>

<p>
Thence, in a south-easterly direction towards the
Passchendaele-Becelaere road, the Canadian Division.
</p>

<p>
Thence a division took up the line in a southerly
direction east of Zonnebeke to a point west of
Becelaere, whence another division continued the
line south-east to the northern limit of the corps on
its right.
</p>

<p>
Of the 5th Corps there were four battalions in
divisional reserve about Ypres; the Canadian
Division had one battalion in divisional reserve, and
the 1st Canadian Brigade in army reserve.  An
infantry brigade, which had just been withdrawn
after suffering heavy losses on Hill 60, was resting
about Vlamertinghe.
</p>

<p>
Following a heavy bombardment, the enemy
attacked the French Division about 5 p.m., using
asphyxiating gases for the first time.  Aircraft
reported that at about 5 p.m. thick yellow smoke had
been seen issuing from the German trenches between
Langemarck and Bixschoote.  The French reported
that two simultaneous attacks had been made east
of the Ypres-Staden railway, in which these
asphyxiating gases had been employed.
</p>

<p>
What followed almost defies description.  The
effect of these poisonous gases was so virulent as
to render the whole of the line held by the French
Division mentioned above practically incapable of
any action at all.  It was at first impossible for
anyone to realise what had actually happened.  The
smoke and fumes hid everything from sight, and
hundreds of men were thrown into a comatose or
dying condition, and within an hour the whole
position had to be abandoned, together with about fifty
guns.
</p>

<p>
I wish particularly to repudiate any idea of
attaching the least blame to the French Division
for this unfortunate incident.
</p>

<p>
After all the examples our gallant Allies have
shown of dogged and tenacious courage in the many
trying situations in which they have been placed
throughout the course of this campaign, it is quite
superfluous for me to dwell on this aspect of the
incident, and I would only express my firm
conviction that if any troops in the world had been
able to hold their trenches in the face of such a
treacherous and altogether unexpected onslaught,
the French Division would have stood firm.
</p>

<p>
The left flank of the Canadian Division was thus
left dangerously exposed to serious attack in flank,
and there appeared to be a prospect of their being
overwhelmed and of a successful attempt by the
Germans to cut off the British troops occupying the
salient to the east.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the danger to which they were exposed,
the Canadians held their ground with a magnificent
display of tenacity and courage; and it is not too
much to say that the bearing and conduct of these
splendid troops averted a disaster which might have
been attended with the most serious consequences.
</p>

<p>
They were supported with great promptitude by
the reserves of the Divisions holding the salient
and by a Brigade which had been resting in billets.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the night the enemy's attacks were
repulsed, effective counter-attacks were delivered,
and at length touch was gained with the French
right, and a new line was formed.
</p>

<p class="thought">
***
<br />
</p>


<p>
The 2nd London Heavy Battery, which had been
attached to the Canadian Division, was posted
behind the right of the French Division, and, being
involved in their retreat, fell into the enemy's hands.
It was recaptured by the Canadians in their counter-attack,
but the guns could not be withdrawn before
the Canadians were again driven back.
</p>

<p>
During the night I directed the Cavalry Corps
and the Northumbrian Division, which was then in
general reserve, to move to the west of Ypres, and
placed these troops at the disposal of the General
Officer Commanding the 2nd Army.  I also directed
other reserve troops from the 3rd Corps and the
1st Army to be held in readiness to meet eventualities.
</p>

<p>
In the confusion of the gas and smoke the
Germans succeeded in capturing the bridge at
Steenstraate and some works south of Lizerne, all of
which were in occupation by the French.
</p>

<p>
The enemy having thus established himself to
the west of the Ypres Canal, I was somewhat
apprehensive of his succeeding in driving a wedge
between the French and Belgian troops at this point.
</p>

<p>
I directed, therefore, that some of the reinforcements
sent north should be used to support and
assist General Putz, should he find difficulty in
preventing any further advance of the Germans west
of the canal.
</p>

<p>
At about ten o'clock on the morning of the 23rd
connection was finally ensured between the left of
the Canadian Division and the French right, about
eight hundred yards east of the canal; but as this
entailed the maintenance by the British troops of a
much longer line than that which they had held
before the attack commenced on the previous night,
there were no reserves available for counter-attack
until reinforcements which were ordered up from
the Second Army were able to deploy to the east
of Ypres.
</p>

<p class="thought">
***
<br />
</p>

<p>
Early on the morning of the 23rd I went to see
General Foch, and from him I received a detailed
account of what had happened, as reported by
General Putz.  General Foch informed me that it
was his intention to make good the original line and
regain the trenches which the French Division had
lost.  He expressed the desire that I should
maintain my present line, assuring me that the original
position would be re-established in a few days.
General Foch further informed me that he had
ordered up large French reinforcements, which
were now on their way, and that troops from the
north had already arrived to reinforce General Putz.
</p>

<p>
I fully concurred in the wisdom of the General's
wish to re-establish our old line, and agreed to
co-operate in the way he desired, stipulating, however,
that if the position was not re-established within a
limited time I could not allow the British troops
to remain in so exposed a situation as that which
the action of the previous twenty-four hours had
compelled them to occupy.
</p>

<p>
During the whole of the 23rd the enemy's artillery
was very active, and his attacks all along the
front were supported by some heavy guns which
had been brought down from the coast in the
neighbourhood of Ostend.
</p>

<p>
The loss of the guns on the night of the 22nd
prevented this fire from being kept down, and much
aggravated the situation.  Our positions, however,
were well maintained by the vigorous counter-attacks
made by the 5th Corps.
</p>

<p>
During the day I directed two Brigades of the
3rd Corps and the Lahore Division of the Indian
Corps to be moved up to the Ypres area and placed
at the disposal of the 2nd Army.
</p>

<p>
In the course of these two or three days many
circumstances combined to render the situation east
of the Ypres Canal very critical and most difficult
to deal with.
</p>

<p>
The confusion caused by the sudden retirement
of the French Division, and the necessity for closing
up the gap and checking the enemy's advance at all
costs, led to a mixing-up of units and a sudden
shifting of the areas of command, which was quite
unavoidable.  Fresh units, as they came up from the
south, had to be pushed into the firing line in an
area swept by artillery fire, which, owing to the
capture of the French guns, we were unable to
keep down.
</p>

<p>
All this led to very heavy casualties, and I wish
to place on record the deep admiration which I feel
for the resource and presence of mind evinced by
the leaders actually on the spot.
</p>

<p>
The parts taken by Major-General Snow and
Brigadier-General Hull were reported to me as
being particularly marked in this respect.
</p>

<p>
An instance of this occurred on the afternoon of
the 24th, when the enemy succeeded in breaking
through the line at St. Julien.
</p>

<p>
Brigadier-General Hull, acting under the orders
of Lieut.-General Alderson, organised a powerful
counter-attack&mdash;on the 24th&mdash;with his own Brigade
and some of the nearest available units.  He was
called upon to control, with only his Brigade Staff,
parts of battalions from six separate Divisions which
were quite new to the ground.  Although the attack
did not succeed in retaking St. Julien, it effectually
checked the enemy's further advance.
</p>

<p>
It was only on the morning of the 25th that the
enemy were able to force back the left of the
Canadian Division from the point where it had originally
joined the French line.
</p>

<p>
During the night and the early morning of the
25th the enemy directed a heavy attack against the
Division at Broodseiende cross-roads, which was
supported by a powerful shell fire, but he failed to
make any progress.
</p>

<p>
During the whole of this time the town of Ypres
and all the roads to the east and west were
uninterruptedly subjected to a violent artillery fire,
but in spite of this the supply of both food and
ammunition was maintained throughout with order
and efficiency.
</p>

<p>
During the afternoon of the 25th many German
prisoners were taken, including some officers.  The
hand-to-hand fighting was very severe, and the
enemy suffered heavy loss.

BATTLE OF FESTUBERT.
</p>

<p>
On May 15th I moved the Canadian Division
into the 1st Corps area and placed them at the
disposal of Sir Douglas Haig.
</p>

<p class="thought">
***
<br />
</p>

<p>
On May 19th the 7th and 2nd Divisions were
drawn out of the line to rest.  The 7th Division was
relieved by the Canadian Division and the 2nd
Division by the 51st (Highland) Division.
</p>

<p>
Sir Douglas Haig placed the Canadian and 51st
Divisions, together with the artillery of the 2nd and
7th Divisions, under the command of Lieut.-General
Alderson, whom he directed to conduct the
operations which had hitherto been carried on by the
General Officer Commanding 1st Corps; and he
directed the 7th Division to remain in Army Reserve.
</p>

<p>
During the night of the 19th-20th a small post of
the enemy in front of La Quinque Rue was captured.
</p>

<p>
During the night of the 20th-21st the Canadian
Division brilliantly carried on the excellent progress
made by the 7th Division by seizing several of the
enemy's trenches and pushing forward their whole
line several hundred yards.  A number of prisoners
and some machine-guns were captured.
</p>

<p>
On the 22nd instant the 51st (Highland) Division
was attached to the Indian Corps, and the General
Officer Commanding the Indian Corps took charge
of the operations at La Quinque Rue, Lieut.-General
Alderson with the Canadians conducting
the operations to the north of that place.
</p>

<p>
On this day the Canadian Division extended their
line slightly to the right and repulsed three very
severe hostile counter-attacks.

GIVENCHY.
</p>

<p>
After the conclusion of the battle of Festubert
the troops of the 1st Army were engaged in several
minor operations.  By an attack delivered on the
evening of June 15th, after a prolonged bombardment,
the 1st Canadian Brigade obtained possession
of the German front-line trenches north-east of
Givenchy, but were unable to retain them owing to
their flanks being too much exposed.

FUTURE OF THE EMPIRE.
</p>

<i>At the Canadian Club, Winnipeg, on December 29th, 1914.</i>
</p>

<p>
It is within the bounds of probability that the four
free nations of the Overseas Dominions will have
put into the fighting line 250,000 men if the war
should continue another year.  That result, or even
the results which have already been obtained, must
mark a great epoch in the history of inter-Imperial
relations.  There are those, within sound of my voice,
who will see the Oversea Dominions surpass in
wealth and population the British Isles.  There are
children playing in your streets who may see Canada
alone attain that eminence.  Thus it is impossible
to believe that the existing status, so far as concerns
the control of foreign policy and extra-Imperial
relations, can remain as it is to-day.  All are
conscious of the complexity of the problem thus
presented, but no one need despair of a satisfactory
solution, and no one can doubt the profound
influence which the tremendous events of the past
few months and those in the immediate future must
exercise upon one of the most interesting and
far-reaching questions ever presented for the
consideration of statesmen.

RESOURCES OF EMPIRE.
</p>

<p class="t3">
<i>At a meeting of the United Kingdom Branch of<br />
the Empire Parliamentary Association, House<br />
of Commons, July 13th, 1915.</i>
</p>

<p>
I appreciate very sincerely, and very warmly as
well, what Mr. Bonar Law said with regard to the
part which Canada has played in this great contest.
There was no doubt in my own mind as to what that
part would be, and I took the responsibility four
days before the actual declaration of war of sending
a message to His Majesty's Government stating
that, if war should unhappily supervene, they might
be assured that Canada would regard the quarrel as
her own, and would do her part in maintaining the
integrity of this Empire and all that this war means
to us.  We are not a military nation in Canada;
we are a peace-loving and peace-pursuing people
with great tasks of development within our own
Dominions lying before us.  Thus, for a struggle
such as this, upon so gigantic a scale, we were
naturally unprepared.  But even so, relatively
unprepared as we were, the Minister of Militia and
Defence in Canada succeeded in placing upon the
Plain of Valcartier, within six weeks of the outbreak
of war, a force of 33,000 men, thoroughly armed
and equipped in every branch of the Service&mdash;artillery,
commissariat, Army Service Corps, and all the
vast organisation that is necessary in war as carried
on in the present day.
</p>

<p>
We have sent overseas up to the present time
nearly 75,000 men, including troops which are doing
garrison duty in the West Indies.  We have in
Canada to-day 75,000 men in training, with organisation
being prepared as rapidly as possible for their
advent to the front when needed.  The response
from every province in Canada, indeed, has been so
warm, so impressive, so inspiring, that our difficulty
has been to secure arms and equipment and material
and all that is necessary to enable our men to go
to the front.  So far as the men were concerned
they were there in abundance.  So far as the other
preparations were concerned we have been very
much in the same condition as yourselves,
unprepared for war upon so tremendous a scale.  In this
conflict we are engaged with great nations whose
military preparation has extended over nearly half
a century, and whose aim, as far as we can
comprehend it, has been world-wide supremacy by force of
arms.  Naturally in the opening months, and the
opening year, of such a struggle we could not
accomplish all that might be expected at first, but I
take comfort in this thought, that for purposes of
war, or for any other purposes, the resources of this
Empire are not only abundant, but almost unlimited,
and there is yet time for that preparation which
perhaps ought to have been made at an earlier day.  The
day of peril came before our day of preparation
had been fully reached.
</p>

<p>
Looking back on what we had to face and upon
what we had to contend with, I venture to think that
the condition of affairs to-day is one upon which we
should rather congratulate ourselves than otherwise.
I have no fear for the future, although the struggle
may be a long one and may entail sacrifices which
we did not anticipate at first.  I think I may bring
to you from the people of Canada this message,
that in whatever is necessary to bring this war to an
honourable and triumphal conclusion, Canada is
prepared to take her part.  And I am sure that is
true of every Dominion of the Empire.  Last
autumn, in speaking before a Canadian club in the
west of Canada, I said that if this war should
continue for a year it was reasonably probable that the
oversea Dominions would have in the field 250,000
men.  I venture to think that to-day, if you estimate
what Australia has done and is doing, what New
Zealand has done and is doing, what South
Africa has done and is doing, and what Canada has
done and is doing, the oversea Dominions of this
Empire have, either in the field, or in training as
organised troops, no less than 350,000 men.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bonar Law has spoken of the courage and
resourcefulness of the Canadian troops.  They went
to the front as men taken from civil avocations of
life, with no prolonged military training, but with
the habit of overcoming obstacles, with a certain
resourcefulness, with all the traditions of the great
races from which they spring, and in such a manner
as made us sure that their record would be worthy
of the great Dominion which they represented.  I
would not speak the truth if I did not confess to
you that I am proud, very proud indeed, of the
part which they have played.  I am equally proud
of the splendid valour shown by the men of these
islands in that great retreat against overwhelming
numbers, under difficulties which I think were
greater than those which ever attended a great
retreat before; and I desire to pay my tribute to the
splendid valour and heroism of the British Army
at that time, worthy of the highest traditions of the
race from which we all spring.  It is almost
superfluous to speak of the splendid valour which
has distinguished the troops of Australia and New
Zealand at the Dardanelles.  I had the pleasure of
sending telegrams to the Governments of these two
Commonwealths and of congratulating them upon
the part which their men are taking in these very
dangerous operations.
</p>

<p>
What a fantastic picture it was that Prussian
militarism made for itself before the outbreak of
this war.  It pictured Canada, Australia, and New
Zealand standing aloof and indifferent, or seeking
an opportunity to cut themselves aloof from this
Empire.  What is the actual picture to-day?  They
are bound to the Empire by stronger ties than ever
before, and are prepared to fight to the death for the
maintenance of its integrity and for the preservation
of our common civilisation throughout the
world.  What of South Africa?  The Prussian
picture was that it should flare into rebellion at
once, cut itself off from the Empire, and proclaim
its independence.  What is the actual picture?  The
heroic figure of General Louis Botha receiving the
surrender of German South-West Africa&mdash;territory
larger than the German Empire itself.
</p>

<p>
We have nothing to fear as the outcome of this
war.  We do not and dare not doubt the success of
the cause for which the British Empire and the
Allied nations are fighting to-day.  It is impossible
to believe that the democracies of the British
Empire, even though unprepared on so tremendous
a scale as our opponents for such a war as this, will
not prove their efficiency in this day of peril.  They
have proved it, and I think they will prove it in the
future.  In the later days when peace comes to be
proclaimed, and after the conclusion of peace, it is
beyond question that large matters will come up for
consideration by the statesmen of the United
Kingdom and the Overseas Dominions.  It is not
desirable, nor perhaps becoming, that I should dwell
upon these considerations to-day.  I said what I
had to say on the subject with considerable
frankness and some emphasis three years ago when I
had the pleasure of addressing you.  What I said
then represents my convictions now.  I do not doubt
the problems which will be presented, exceedingly
difficult and complex as they are, will find a wise
and just solution, and in thanking you for the
reception which you have accorded me to-day, and for
the honour which you have done to the Dominion
which I represent as its Prime Minister, let me
express the hope and aspiration that in confronting
the immense responsibilities which devolve upon
those inheriting so great an Empire as ours, and
one which must necessarily command so profound
an influence on the future of civilisation and the
destiny of the world, we shall so bear ourselves,
whether in these mother islands or in the Overseas
Dominions, that the future shall hold in store no
reproach for us for lack of vision, want of courage,
or failure of duty.

Freedom of the City of London, July 19th, 1915.</i>

<p>
I appreciate the honour which has been conferred
upon me, coming as it does from a city which may
be described as a great Imperial City, in a fashion
which is perhaps not known elsewhere throughout
the world to-day.  Through the march of civilisation
across the centuries, the progress and development
of London have kept time with the march.
That it is a great Imperial City to-day is due to
the great achievement of our race.  While it may
not be fitting that one of our kindred should speak
of the British people as a great race, I may be
permitted to say that it has wrought great things, and
that the greatest of all its achievements is the
up-building of an Empire bound together by such ties
as those which unite ours.
</p>

<p>
In the beginning, in the founding of the nation
within these islands, there was need for orderly
government, and that made necessary a strong and
autocratic system of government.  But, as the years
rolled on, there came to the people the right to
govern themselves.  Orderly government, individual
liberty, equal rights before the people&mdash;upon these
secure foundations the fabric of the national life
was erected, and in these later days has come the
not less noble ideal of a democracy founded upon
equality of opportunity for all the people before
the conditions of modern life.
</p>

<p>
In the Dominions beyond the seas, the same ideals
of liberty and of justice have led inevitably to the
establishment of self-governing institutions.  Their
development there has been very much the same as
within your own islands, and those short-sighted
ones who believed that the right to govern
themselves would drive the far-flung nations of our
Empire asunder, have found that that very circumstance,
and that free development, have united them
by ties stronger than would be possible under any
system of autocratic government.
</p>

<p>
I have listened with the deepest possible
appreciation to the words which have been spoken of the
action of Canada in this war.  That action was due
to no Government, to no statesman or group of
statesmen.  It was due to the spirit of the Canadian
people, a spirit which will make the cause for which
we are contending victorious, and which will
pervade the Dominions to the end.  I do not need to
tell you of the part that Canada has played and the
part she proposes to play.  But it might not be
amiss for a moment to allude to the remarkable
circumstance that four great Overseas Dominions,
self-governing Dominions of the Empire, have been
actuated by a common impulse at this
juncture&mdash;Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada!
Why have all these great free nations sent their men
from the remotest corners of the earth to fight side
by side with you of this island home in this quarrel?
Why in Canada do we see those who are the
descendants of those who fought under Wolfe, and
of those who fought under Montcalm, standing side
by side in the battle-line of the Empire?  Why,
coming down to later days, do we see the grandson
of a Durham, and the grandson of a Papineau,
standing shoulder to shoulder beyond the Channel
in France or Belgium?  When the historian of the
future comes to analyse the events which made it
possible for the Empire to stand like this, he
will see that there must have been some overmastering
impulse contributing to this wonderful result.
</p>

<p>
One such impulse is to be found in the love of
liberty, the pursuit of ideals of democracy, and the
desire and determination to preserve the spirit of
unity founded on those ideals, which make the whole
Empire united in aim and single in purpose.  But
there was, also, in all the Overseas Dominions, the
intense conviction that this war was forced upon the
Empire&mdash;that we could not with honour stand aside
and see trampled underfoot the liberties and
independence of a weak and unoffending nation whose
independence we had guaranteed.  And, above and
beyond all that, was the realisation of the supreme
truth&mdash;that the quarrel in which we are engaged
transcends even the destinies of our own Empire
and involves the future of civilisation and of the
world.
</p>

<p>
We must not forget that in this war we are
confronting the power of a military autocracy more
highly organised, and more formidable, perhaps than
was ever nation before in history.  I am sure that
the military strength which has been developed by
our chief antagonists, has surprised the whole world;
and I think that this war will bring to us a very
vital question as to the future of democratic
institutions.  We have always cherished in these islands,
and in the Oversea Dominions as well, the ideal
of orderly government coupled with that of
individual liberty.  It remains to be seen, as the war
proceeds, whether individual liberty, within the
British Isles and the Overseas Dominions, is coupled
with so strong a sense of duty and of service to the
State&mdash;whether in Peace or in war&mdash;as to make it
possible for us to withstand the onslaught of so
formidable a foe.
</p>

<p>
For myself, I have no doubt as to the issue,
because I remember that, if we take the British Empire
alone, our resources are infinitely greater than those
of Germany; and, if we consider the question of
population, that of the British Isles and of the
Overseas Dominions is almost equal to that of Germany.
it is true that we were not prepared, as Germany
was prepared, for war on this scale; but I believe
the time for preparation is not past, and I feel also
that we have every reason to congratulate ourselves
upon the splendid preparation which has been made,
not only in these islands, but in the Dominions.
Yet I would impress upon the people of the Empire
that all for which our fathers fought and bled, all
our liberties and institutions, all the influences for
good which have been sent forth by the activities
of the Empire throughout the world, hang in the
balance to-day, and therefore we cannot, because
we must not, fall in this war.
</p>

<p>
During the past week I visited France, and I
have seen some of our forces at the front.  It is a
very inspiring thing to see a nation under arms.
The manhood of France, except those engaged in
industrial pursuits, is at the front to-day; and yet
I have seen the whole country up to the lines of
the trenches, bearing bountiful harvests.  The soil
was prepared, the seed was planted, and the harvest
is now being reaped by old men and women and
children.  It is my intense conviction that a nation
so inspired can never perish or be subdued; and I
am glad to remember this great Allied nation is of
our own kin, because you in the British Isles look
back to Celtic and Norman, as well as to Saxon
ancestors; and if this be true of you in Britain it is
still more true of us in Canada.
</p>

<p>
Last week I looked into the keen, intent faces, of
10,000 Canadian soldiers, within sound and range
of the German guns.  Three days ago I looked into
the undaunted eyes of 1,000 Canadian
convalescents returned from the valley of the shadow
of death.  In the eyes, and in the faces of those
men, I read only one message&mdash;that of resolute
and unflinching determination to make our cause
triumphant; to preserve our institutions and our
liberties, to maintain the unity of our Empire and its
influence through the world.  That message, which
I bring to you from those soldiers, I bring you also
from the great Dominion which has sent those men
across the sea.
</p>

<p>
While the awful shadow of this war overhangs
our Empire, I shall not pause to speak of what may
be evolved in its constitutional relations.  Upon
what has been built in the past it is possible, in my
judgment, that an even nobler and more enduring
fabric may be erected.  That structure must embody
the autonomy of the self-governing Dominions and
of the British Isles as well, but it must also embody
the majesty and power of an Empire united by ties
such as those of which I have spoken, and more
thoroughly and effectively organised for the purpose
of preserving its own existence.  Those who shall be
the architects of this monument will have a great
part to play, and I do not doubt that they will play
it worthily.  To those who shall be called to design
so splendid a fabric, crowning the labours of the
past and embodying all the hopes of the future, we
all of us bid God speed in their great task.

<p class="t3">
<i>At a patriotic meeting at the London Opera House,<br />
August 4th, 1915.</i>
</p>

<p>
Considering all the events of the year, there are
indeed some matters on which we have the right and
privilege to-night of congratulating ourselves to the
full.  Was the unity of this Empire ever so strikingly
made manifest before?  Was it ever more clearly
demonstrated that the race which inhabits these
islands and the Overseas Dominions is not a
decadent race?  What has been the result of the call
of duty to this Empire?  You in these islands
debated years ago, and not so long ago for that
matter, as to whether in case of necessity you could
send abroad an Expeditionary Force of 80,000 or
120,000 or 160,000 men, and if I am not mistaken
the most optimistic among you believed that 160,000
men was the limit.  What has been the result of the
call?  You have in part organised, and you are now
organising, armies from ten to twenty times greater
than those which were the limit you set for yourselves
in the past.  That is not an indication of a decadent
race, and I am glad indeed to know that we in the
Overseas Dominions as well are doing our part as
best we can.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, in Canada, and I believe the same is true
in all the Overseas Dominions, the difficulty has been
with armament and equipment&mdash;all that is necessary
for the organisation of a great modern army,
and not with the provision of men, for the men came
faster than we were able to organise the armour to
equip them.  And so it has been in India as well.  I
remember having, in the early months of the war, the
privilege of reading a debate which took place in the
Council of India, a great debate which was worthy of
the Mother of Parliaments herself; a debate couched
in language of the most intense patriotism; and in
that debate the demand of India was that she should
be permitted to do her part in this war.  The same
is true of Egypt and all the Crown Colonies.  From
East to West, from North to South, throughout the
Empire, the response on all hands has been more
than we could have ventured to anticipate.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Balfour has referred in the most eloquent and
appropriate terms to the work of the great Navy
which is under his direction, and which has
accomplished its task so wonderfully ever since the war
broke out.  We of the Overseas Dominions realise
as much as you realise, that the pathways of the seas
are the veins and arteries of this Empire through
which its lifeblood must flow.  If these are once
stopped or interfered with in any way the Empire
cannot continue to exist.  We are as conscious as
you are conscious of the wonderful vigil in the North
Sea and of the patience, endurance, and fortitude of
officers and men.  We are grateful, as you are
grateful, with the most intense appreciation of all they
have done for us, and, more than all, the fact
that they have rid the seas of the marauders by
which our commerce was troubled has enabled us
to keep in close contact with you, and keep up
that intercourse which is so absolutely necessary
for you and for us, not only in war but in peace as well.
</p>

<p>
I have no military knowledge nor experience&mdash;I
am going to say a word with regard to military affairs
in a moment&mdash;but before doing that I would like to
express my own appreciation, and I think of all the
people in the Dominion which I have the honour to
represent, of the splendid work which has been done
by the Royal Flying Corps in this war.  Knowing
the great efforts that have been made by other
nations in this particular branch of the military and
naval services, we were rather inclined to anticipate
and expect that it might not be up to the highest
standard of the great nations of the world.  I have
good reason to know, because I have had some
intimate accounts of what has transpired at the
front&mdash;I have good reason to know that the work of our
aeroplane service has been equal to the best, and
that in initiative, courage, resourcefulness, and
fortitude our men have held their place with the best,
ever since the outbreak of this war.
</p>

<p>
It is not necessary to dwell on the valour of our
troops, to which eloquent reference has been made
by Lord Crewe and Mr. Balfour.  I do not believe
that in all the splendid traditions of the British Army
for centuries past, a more splendid record can be
shown than that displayed in the retreat from Mons.
I believe that no retirement was ever conducted
successfully under greater difficulties and against
more overwhelming odds, and the conduct of officers
and men adds glory to the British Army that will not
be forgotten as long as our race endures.  I may,
perhaps, be permitted to say that those who were sent
across the sea to France and to the Dardanelles, from
Australia, from New Zealand, from Canada, have
proved that the old traditions of our race are not
forgotten overseas, and that the men there are prepared
in any danger, in any peril, to stand side by side with
their comrades of these islands.  A splendid force
has been raised in South Africa, and I associate
myself with what has been so well said as to the
valour of the troops from India, who have fought by
the side of our men in France and Belgium.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Balfour has spoken of our Allies, and with
what he has said I may be permitted to associate
myself.  One cannot forget the courage, the patience,
the fortitude of France.  We know that the soul of
Russia is unconquered and unconquerable.  The
devotion and heroism of Belgium and Serbia have
moved the admiration of the world.  The fine valour
of Italy is now in the fighting line with the Allies,
and she is doing her appointed task as we expected
she would do it.  She stands ready, I imagine, for
further services in case the emergencies of this war
should demand them.  I have said before that this
is not like the wars of a hundred or two hundred
years ago.
</p>

<p>
This is a war of nations, and not of armies alone.
But it is more than that.  It is a war of material
resources to an extreme degree.  The industrial
resources of the nations are being organised; all that
the knowledge and science of the nations can devise
is being brought into play.  The command of the
forces of nature which in the past centuries, and
especially in the past 100 years, we have learned has
been brought to bear, and for that reason I have
every confidence in the outcome of this struggle,
because we have within this Empire resources almost
limitless&mdash;resources infinitely greater than those of
Germany and Austria-Hungary combined, and it
merely depends upon our self-denial, and organised
capacity and patriotism, as to whether we can and
shall organise those resources to the end that our
cause shall triumph.
</p>

<p>
I do not believe that we shall fail in that.  Our
race has never failed in time of crisis.  Why should
it fail now?  To fail in doing that would be
accounted to us, in the years to come, as dishonour.
We will not fail.  All that men can do, our men have
done at the front, and they will continue to do in
the future.
</p>

<p>
In Canada, we began, as early as possible, to
organise our industrial resources for the production
of munitions of war.  We made our first effort as far
back as August 21st.  Munitions of war have been
the great and growing need of our men at the front.
Because it is apparent to us that, so far as it is in the
power of this Empire to strain every effort for the
purposes of the war, we must not attempt to do with
men alone what our enemies are doing with
munitions and guns.
</p>

<p>
As to what we have done in the past, whether in
Canada or in these islands or elsewhere, let the dead
past bury its dead.  This is not the time to speak
of the past, but to look at the future.  What
concerns us, whether in these islands or in any of the
Overseas Dominions, is to see that, so far as the
future is concerned, there shall be no failure; and I
believe there will be no failure.
</p>

<p>
It may be said that in some respects the twelve
months' war has not been all that we anticipated.
I believe I am entirely within the bounds of truth
when I state that if there is any disappointment with
us, the disappointment of Germany is tenfold
greater; and if there has been any disappointment,
or if there should be any reverse in the future, that
should merely inspire us with a higher resolve and
a more inflexible determination to do our duty, and
to see that that which concerns the cause of civilisation
and humanity shall be carried to the issue which
we all desire.
</p>

<p>
For a hundred years we have not had any wars
which threatened the existence of our Empire, and
for more than fifty years we have not been involved
in any war which might perhaps be called a great
one.  Under the conditions of modern democracies,
here and elsewhere in the Empire, considerations of
material prosperity have been urged, and this is
especially a danger in a new country like Australia
or Canada.  The call of the market-place has been
sometimes clamorous and insistent, and in days such
as these the soul of a nation is more truly tried than
it is in war days, for the highest character of an
Empire is sometimes formed then&mdash;and not in the
days of stress and trial&mdash;through the consequences
of duty and self-sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
I rejoice greatly that in these islands, and in the
Overseas Dominions, men have realised most fully
that there is something greater than material
prosperity, something greater than life itself.  This war
cannot fail to influence most profoundly the whole
future of the world and of civilisation.  It has
already most profoundly influenced the people of
this Empire.  There were great strivings for wealth,
everywhere, but no one could deny that the material
advancement and prosperity of the Empire has not
in itself been a good thing.  The standards of life
for the people have been raised and comfort
increased.  It is not the wealth we should rail at.
Rome fell, I know, at a time of wealth, but it was
because she made wealth her god.
</p>

<p>
In the early days of the war we were much
comforted by the fact that men and women were ready
to make sacrifices for this, the greatest cause of all.
In Canada, and I am sure elsewhere throughout the
Empire, there has been manifest a spirit of co-operation,
of mutual helpfulness, of a desire to assist, of
self-sacrifice which is most comforting to those who
have at heart the welfare of our Empire in years to
come.  So I am sure it will be in the future.  The
influence of a spirit of helpfulness and self-sacrifice,
which we see everywhere throughout the world, and
within our Empire, is one for which I give thanks
and am most grateful.
</p>

<p>
I have come far across this ocean to see our men
within these islands and at the front, and our men
in hospital who are wounded.  To see them, whether
at the front, where they stand almost within the
valley of the shadow of death, or wounded in the
hospitals, is an inspiration in itself.  I am glad to
say that in visiting the hospitals I have had the
opportunity of speaking to many soldiers, officers
and men, from these islands, and with them I have
found, as among our Canadians, just one spirit&mdash;a
wonderful spirit of heroism and of patience, a spirit
of consecration to the cause we all have at heart.
We who come from overseas are touched by all this,
perhaps more than you can imagine.
</p>

<p>
Last night I walked down the Embankment.  At
my right was the great Abbey, at my left the great
Cathedral.  The historic river was at my feet.
Here came in bygone centuries the Celt, the Saxon,
the Dane, the Norman, each in turn, finally all in
co-operation, lending their influence to our national life.
And how splendid a structure they built; what an
influence for good it has carried throughout the
world!
</p>

<p>
Standing thus on what seems to us hallowed
ground, we of the Overseas Dominions meditate
perhaps more than you do on the wonderful memories
of the past, and the great events to which the life of
our Empire has moved.  Let us never for one
moment forget that of all the mighty events in our
history, none are greater than those through which
we are passing to-day.  Is an Empire like ours
worth living for?  Yes, and worth dying for, too.
And it is something greater than it was a year ago.
Indeed, it can never be quite the same again.  The
old order has in some measure passed away.  Once
for all it has been borne in upon the minds and souls
of all of us that the great policies, which touch and
control the issues of peace and war, concern more
than the peoples of these islands.
</p>

<p>
And more than that, we shall so bear ourselves
in this war, and in the mighty events to which it
must lead, that whether in these islands or in the
Overseas Dominions, citizenship of this Empire
shall be a still greater and more noble possession
in the years to come than it has been even in the
glorious past.  I have spoken to you frankly on some
matters of great moment.  If I had not done so I
should have been unworthy of my position.  And
now, before I close, let me bring to you this latest
message from Canada:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
For those who have fallen in this struggle we
shall not cease to mourn; for the cause which they
have consecrated their lives we shall not cease to
strive.  We are supremely confident that that cause
will assuredly triumph and for that great purpose
we are inspired with an inflexible determination to
do our part.

<p>
The fall of Warsaw has been foreshadowed for
some time, and it is useless for us to deny the
Germans have achieved a success&mdash;which they
intended to achieve six or nine months ago.
</p>

<p>
This fall will mean that all will put forth greater
efforts and determination.  In the early months of
the war we failed to estimate the enormous military
power of a nation, highly disciplined and thoroughly
organised for war as well as for peace.  The idea
of the people of these islands was to send across
the Channel an expeditionary force not exceeding
160,000 men.
</p>

<p>
Do any of you, who have not had the responsibilities
of office, realise what it means to provide
guns, rifles, ammunition, and equipment for a force
ten times as great&mdash;with, perhaps, another force in
reserve of equal number?  I know something of
those responsibilities.  We in Canada have our
difficulties, not in finding men ready to fight for the
cause, but because we find it difficult to provide the
guns, rifles, ammunition, and equipment.
</p>

<p>
When you increase your proposed expeditionary
force by ten or twenty times, you must realise that
for that purpose it is necessary that the whole power
of the nation shall be concentrated on the task.
</p>

<p>
I hold this profound conviction&mdash;that, regiment
for regiment and man for man, our forces can hold
their own, and more than hold their own, with the
best and most efficient troops of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
If we speak of the disappointments we had at the
start of the war, let us never forget to realise that
the disappointments of the enemy must be ten
times greater.  And if we are discouraged from time
to time, let us remember we have accomplished one
great work which outweighs a thousandfold that,
and that is the clearness and security of the pathways
of the seas.  The clearance of the seas means as
much to the Allies as to ourselves.

<h4>
LT.-GENERAL E. A. H. ALDERSON, C.B.,<br />
COMMANDING THE CANADIAN CORPS.
</h4>

<p>
The following is the text of the speech made to
the Canadian troops under his command after twelve
strenuous days and nights of fighting, from April
23rd to May 4th, 1915.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I tell you truly, that my heart is so full that
I hardly know how to speak to you.  It is full
of two feelings&mdash;the first being sorrow for the
loss of those comrades of ours who have gone;
and the second, pride in what the 1st Canadian
Division has done.
</p>

<p class="quote">
As regards our comrades who have lost their
lives&mdash;let us speak of them with our caps
off&mdash;my faith in the Almighty is such that I am
perfectly sure that when men die, as they have
died, doing their duty and fighting for their
country, for the Empire, and to save the
situation for others&mdash;in fact, have <i>died for their
friends</i>&mdash;no matter what their past lives have
been, no matter what they have done that they
ought not to have done (as all of us do), I am
perfectly sure that the Almighty takes them
and looks after them at once.  Lads, we cannot
leave them better than like that.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Now I feel that we may, without any false
pride, think a little of what the Division has
done during the past few days.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I would first of all tell you that I have never
been so proud of anything in my life as I am
of my armlet with "Canada" on it.  I thank
you, and congratulate you from the bottom of
my heart, for the part each one of you has
taken in giving me this feeling of pride.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I think it is possible that all of you do not
quite realise that, if we had retired on the
evening of April 22nd&mdash;when our Allies fell
back before the gas and left our left flank
quite open&mdash;the whole of the 27th and 28th
Divisions would probably have been cut off.
Certainly they would not have got away a gun
or a vehicle of any sort, and probably not more
than half the Infantry would have escaped.
</p>

<p class="quote">
This is what our Commander-in-Chief meant
when he telegraphed, as he did, that "the
Canadians saved the situation."  My lads, if
ever men had a right to be proud in this world,
you have.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I know my military history pretty well, and
I cannot think of an instance, especially when
the cleverness and determination of the enemy
is taken into account, in which troops were
placed in such a difficult position; nor can I
think of an instance in which so much depended
on the standing fast of one Division.
</p>

<p class="quote">
You will remember that the last time I spoke
to you, just before you went into the trenches
at Sailly, now over two months ago, I told you
about my old Regiment&mdash;the Royal West
Kents&mdash;having gained a reputation for never
budging from their trenches, no matter how
they were attacked.  I said then I was quite
sure that, in a short time, the Army out here
would be saying the same of you.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I little thought&mdash;none of us thought&mdash;how
soon those words would come true.  But now,
to-day, not only the Army out here, but all
Canada, all England, and all the Empire are
saying that you, too, stand fast.
</p>

<p class="quote">
There is one more word I would say to you
before I stop.  You have made a reputation
second to none in this war; but, remember, no
man can live on his reputation.  He must keep
on adding to it.  And I feel just as sure that
you will do so as I did two months ago when
I told you that I knew you would make a
reputation when the opportunity came.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I am now going to shake hands with your
officers, and as I do so, I want you to feel that
I am shaking hands with each one of you, as I
would actually do if time permitted.

issued by Lieut.-General Alderson on transferring
the 1st Canadian Division to the new Commander,
General Currie, C.B.:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="quote">
On handing over the command of the 1st
Canadian Division to General Currie, C.B., I
wish to give my heartfelt thanks to all ranks
of the Division, and especially to the Brigadiers
and the Divisional and Brigade Staffs, for the
loyal and efficient help they have given me
during the eleven months that I have
commanded the Division.  It is this help that, in
spite of the difficulties of organisation, or the
trying climatic and other unpleasant conditions
of Salisbury Plain, has made my period of
command so pleasant.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I have already expressed personally, to all
ranks, my appreciation of the conduct of the
Division in action at all times, and especially
during the trying twelve days&mdash;April 22nd to
May 4th&mdash;at Ypres.  I will not, therefore, say
any more about this conduct, except that I
shall never forget it.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I am consoled in my great regret at leaving
the Division by the thought that, as Corps
Commander, I shall still be in close touch
with it.
</p>

<p class="quote">
In handing over to General Currie I feel,
as I have told him, that I hand over an efficient
fighting unit, which, I am sure, will, under him,
add to the reputation it has made, and also
give him the same loyal support that it has
always given to me.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I feel that I cannot conclude better than by
asking all ranks of the 1st Division always to
remember the words which I am adopting as
the motto of the Canadian Army Corps:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

EVEN NAPIER HAS WRITTEN NOTHING BETTER.
</p>

<p>
"I have no hesitation in saying that Sir Max Aitken is to be
ranked with Sir William Napier in the power of describing a battle.
The book should be in the hands of every reader in the Empire,
for the inspiring quality of it, its nobility, its bravery.  It is in his
description of the part played by the Canadians in the Battle of
Ypres that Sir Max Aitken touches his highest, and that is so high
that hardly anyone has surpassed it.  Even Napier has written
nothing better than Sir Max Aitken's account of the second battle of
Ypres&mdash;a battle which we won, surely, by the direct grace of
God."&mdash;Sir W. Robertson Nicoll in the <i>British Weekly</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
A LIVING BARRIER.
</p>

<p>
"Excellently done....  With the aid of excellent sketch maps
every phase can here be followed of the fight in which the Canadians,
first alone, and then foremost among the reinforcements, improvised
and maintained a living barrier against the flood of the German
army which had poured through the great breach on the British
flank, and thus averted, in Sir John French's significant words, a
'disaster which might have been attended with the most serious
consequences.'"&mdash;<i>The Times</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
A BOOK WHICH WILL LIVE.
</p>

<p>
"The story of how the Canadians fought at Neuve Chapelle,
Ypres, at Givenchy, at Festubert, as he tells it here, is as absorbing
as ever, and our pride in the lavish bravery and sacrifice of the
daughter nation is, if that were possible, strengthened by reading
these pages....  It will be one of the books on the war which will
live."&mdash;<i>Daily Telegraph</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
A GREAT BOOK.
</p>

<p>
"A great book by a big man&mdash;Sir Max Aitken deserves not merely
compliments and unstinted praise, but thanks as well."&mdash;<i>Reynolds's
Newspaper</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
CLEAR BATTLE PICTURES.
</p>

<p>
"The splendid work of the Canadians on the Western front
makes a fine story in the pages of 'Canada in Flanders,' by Sir Max
Aitken, M.P.  He writes an easy style, and when describing a
complicated battlefield can bring clear pictures of its events before
the reader.  The most important chapter is headed 'Ypres.'  It
gives the best and most lucid account we have yet seen of the
battles which followed the German gas attack last
April."&mdash;<i>Manchester Guardian</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
AN EMPIRE ANNAL.
</p>

<p>
"A book to thrill and inspire ... to read the story told by Sir
Max Aitken is to read one of the finest stories in the annals of the
Empire."&mdash;<i>Sunday Times</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
STORIES THAT THRILL.
</p>

<p>
"One of the clearest expositions and most effective pieces of
writing we remember to have read....  His stories will thrill his
readers not only in Canada ... but wherever the English
language is read."&mdash;<i>Standard</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
HEROIC DEEDS.
</p>

<p>
"The heroic deeds of the Canadians at Ypres make one tingle with
pride to be a kinsman to such soldiers.  Farmers and fruit farmers,
editors and ranchers all showed themselves to be of the finest fighting
stuff in the world."&mdash;<i>Evening Standard</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
TWO NEW BRUNSWICKERS.
</p>

<p>
"Not only has Canada sent us splendid troops, but New
Brunswick (there is a fine irony in the name) has strengthened our
arm in sending us Mr. Bonar Law....  Another New Brunswicker,
also a Scots minister's son, who has made good is Sir Max Aitken.
His book of the Canadians in Flanders is now one of the liveliest
(and truest) stories on the bookstalls."&mdash;<i>Graphic</i>.

<p class="t3b">
CANADA'S AGINCOURT.
</p>

<p>
"What Agincourt is to the English reader of Shakespeare Ypres

of the heart-grips in a great battle."&mdash;<i>Observer</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
WITHIN SOUND OF THE GUNS.
</p>

<p>
"The Official Historian of the Canadian Expeditionary Force,
whoever he may be ... cannot hope to match the vivid narrative,
written, as one may say, within sound of the guns, in which Sir Max
Aitken relates the deeds of the gallant men with whom he served in
Flanders."&mdash;<i>Daily Chronicle</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
CANADA'S ACHIEVEMENT.
</p>

<p>
"Sir Max Aitken is a worthy chronicler of great deeds, and his
introductory chapters alone add materially to our knowledge of the
greatness of Canada's achievement.  Most space is naturally given
to the share of the Canadians in the battles of Neuve Chapelle and
Ypres, which are vividly described from the military and human
standpoint."&mdash;<i>Daily Graphic</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
DEATHLESS EXPLOITS AT YPRES.
</p>

<p>
"The deathless exploit of the Canadians in stemming the German
onrush at Ypres and frustrating the expected gains of the gas trick
will often be retold, but never, we think, to the displacement of the
version here given, with its tense reality and unforced power.  The
author has succeeded in combining a clear impression of the engagement
and its objective as a whole with a sufficiency of detail to let us
understand something of the character of such warfare from the
individual's point of view....  Canada has been fortunate in her
Record Officer."&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
FASCINATING IMPRESSIONS.
</p>

<p>
"What a fascinating book this is.  It has some thrilling stories of
the heroism of the gallant Canadian soldiers.  Sir Max Aitken can
write.  It was he, you remember, who was responsible for the only
official story of the heroic fighting at Ypres that really gave an
adequate impression of the battle, and everyone was wondering for
days after the publication of that account who the brilliant author
could be.  Well, his new book is better than that account and tells
more not only of what the men did, but which men and which
regiments took part in the now historic struggles round ruined
Ypres."&mdash;"The Rambler" in the <i>Daily Mirror</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
A VERITABLE EPIC.
</p>

<p>
"This is one of the many good books of the war which rank with
those of 'Ian Hay,' 'Sapper,' and Mr. John Buchan.  Such books
are not likely to be affected by the 'slump' in war books of which
we hear.  They are indispensable....  A veritable epic of Canada's
share in the war."&mdash;Clement Shorter in <i>The Sphere</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
A JOYOUS SHILLINGSWORTH.
</p>

<p>
"The Secretary of State for the Colonies is correct in his description
of Sir Max Aitken's work as 'a model of lucid, picturesque, and
sympathetic narrative.' ... A joyous shillingsworth&mdash;the best we
have seen for a long time."&mdash;<i>Morning Post</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
BRAVERY AND SACRIFICE.
</p>

<p>
"It is a thrilling record of the manner in which Canada has played
her part in the great fight on the Western front, and hitherto
unpublished stories of extraordinary feats of bravery and sacrifice for
others are told.  As a record of what the Canadians have
accomplished for the Motherland it is one of the best books the war has
produced, and it is written in such an interesting form that it can and
should be read by all of the English-speaking race."&mdash;<i>Star</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
A FLAME OF PATRIOTISM.
</p>

<p>
"Of the making of books on the war there is no end.  But few
have achieved, or will achieve, the popularity that is certainly
destined for 'Canada in Flanders.' ... To English readers, of
whom there will be many, the chapters which deal with the raising
of the corps in Canada will, perhaps for the first time, bring realization
of the flame of patriotism which spread like a prairie fire through
the Dominion at the outbreak of the war."&mdash;<i>Lloyd's Weekly</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
AN ARMY OF AMATEURS.
</p>

<p>
"Sir Max points out, over and over again, that the Canadian
Army is almost entirely an army of amateurs.  Princess Patricia's
Light Infantry was recruited from old soldiers, but the rest of the
Canadian army was made up of men without military experience.
This fact is of immense significance, particularly as it is equally true
of the greater part of the British forces."&mdash;<i>Daily Express</i>.
